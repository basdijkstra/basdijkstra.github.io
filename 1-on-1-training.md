Are you looking for a more personal approach to training than my [classroom-based training courses](/training/)?

I am happy to offer **1-on-1, deep dive, hands-on, 4-hour training sessions** for individuals looking to upgrade their test automation skills.

Here's how it works:

* You fill in the form below to register your interest in a 1-on-1 training session
* We'll schedule a short call to get to know each other and work out the program, topics, and technology stack based on your experience and learning needs
* We'll then work out the logistics (dates, online learning platform, payment, etc.)
* On training day, we'll spend 4 hours working together on solving realistic problems and upgrading your automation experience and skills
* At the end of the session, you'll receive tailored advice on where to go from here and continue your learning journey
* 2-3 weeks after the training session, we'll have a 45-minute follow-up call to check in on what you've learned and how you have applied it

The all-in price for 4 hours of customized, individual learning and 45 minutes of post-training follow-up is **EUR 599** (excluding VAT).

Interested? Please reach out by filling in the form below. I'll get back to you as soon as possible to schedule a discovery call.

Please note that your email address will only be used to communicate about the requested training. It will not be stored or used in any other way.
