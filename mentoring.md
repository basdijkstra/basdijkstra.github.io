Are you interested in [test automation training](/training/), but can't find the group or the funds to bring in someone to run corporate training in your company?

Or are you looking for a more individual, personal approach that caters to _your_ specific learning needs and requirements?

My mentoring services might be just what you're looking for.

#### What does a mentoring engagement look like?

A typical mentoring engagement with me will look like this:

* First, we discuss where you are currently with your test automation and / or programming skills, and where you want to be when we wrap up the mentoring program.
* Then, we compile and agree on a learning curriculum and schedule that is personalized to your specific needs.
* In weekly sessions, we'll go through the things you want to learn, the questions you have and the problems you're facing.
* Between sessions, you will receive tailored take-home exercises to practice what you've learned and further hone your skills.

#### Scheduling

Mentoring sessions will typically be scheduled 1 to 2 times a week, at 60 to 120 minutes per session. My schedule is flexible, though, so I'm happy to customize where I can. 

Due to the highly personalized nature of mentoring, I will allow at most 3 people to participate in a session. If you have a larger group, why not considering booking me [as a trainer](/training/) instead? 

#### Pricing 

I charge an hourly rate for mentoring sessions, with the price depending on the number of participants:

| # of participants | price per hour | price per participant per hour |
|-------------------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| 1                 | EUR 100        | EUR 100                        |
| 2                 | EUR 130        | EUR  65                        |
| 3                 | EUR 150        | EUR  50                        |

All prices are excluding VAT (where applicable).

An initial discovery session, where we explore your requirements and create a schedule for learning, is free of charge.

I am also available for single, one-off mentoring sessions, at a rate of EUR 200 per hour excluding VAT.
