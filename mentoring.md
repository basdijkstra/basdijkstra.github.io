While [classroom-based training](/training/) is a great way to get introduced to a specific topic or area of expertise, it takes more than attending a three-day course to truly grow your skill set as an automation engineer or developer.

One of the biggest challenges of 'traditional' training courses is translating what you've learned in the course to your own context and your own day job.

My mentoring services are meant to bridge that gap, because instead of me teaching _my_ material to you and a group of your peers, we'll be working together to build real-world solutions to real-world problems, _in your specific context_.

Participants will work with me for between 4 and 8 hours per week, and I'll teach you what it takes to write, run and maintain tests against the applications that you are responsible for when it comes to testing and automation.

And, as part of the process, you'll write, maintain and run an automation solution that will deliver value to you and your team every time it runs your tests. 

To ensure that you get the return on your investment you deserve, some conditions do apply:

* We _have to_ be able to work in your environment and infrastructure and with your code and applications. If this means onboarding me as an external member of staff, I'm happy to do that.
* The maximum group size is _limited to 3 participants_ to make sure that the participants get all the time and attention they deserve and need to grow.
* Depending on the current and target level of experiences of the participants, expect mentoring sessions to run for anywhere between _3 and 12 months_.
* Ideally, all contact hours are _on-site_, but I'm open to discussing running (part of) the sessions online.

I [wrote a blog post with more details](/an-alternative-to-corporate-training/) about the mentoring process and the benefits, based on a mentoring client I'm currently working with, so by all means read that first if you want to learn more about this offering.

If you're interested in working with me, feel free to send me an email at bas@ontestautomation.com, or use the [contact form](/contact/) to get in touch.
