You can contact me by filling in the form below. Please note that your email address will only be used to respond to your query. It will not be stored or used in any other way.

Before you send me a message, please consider the following:

* I provide corporate training for team and companies, which means that I cannot cater to individuals expressing their interest in my courses.
* I am unable to take on requests for 1-on-1 individual training. If you're looking for training as an individual, why not check out one of my [open source workshops](open-source-workshops.md)?
* If you have a technical question regarding a specific test automation problem, you're probably way better off asking the [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/){:target="_blank"} community.
