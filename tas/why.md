ParaBank releases a new version of their software four times a year. They would love to release more often.

One of the things that is keeping them from releasing more often is their current testing process.

Apart from testing the improvements, new features and bug fixes that have been introduced since the previous release, they have hundreds of regression tests that they need to execute to make sure that their customers can still perform all major online banking tasks.

Executing these regression tests takes a long time, but they are deemed necessary.

A past effort to try and automate the regression tests failed spectacularly. This cost ParaBank a lot of money, and has left the ParaBank management team somewhat disillusioned when it comes to test automation.
