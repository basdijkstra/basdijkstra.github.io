**NOTE: All original workshop dates as listed in the blog post and on LinkedIn are fully booked. Additional dates have been scheduled.** 

You can use the below form to register for any of my upcoming free, hands-on workshops.

More information about the why, what and how of these free workshops can be found [in this blog post](/free-public-workshops-a-new-initiative/). 

If you have any questions prior to registering for a workshop, please email bas@ontestautomation.com.

Please only register for a workshop if you intend to attend the session and actively participate in the exercises and discussions.  

When registered, you'll receive a confirmation email from me as soon as I've read your registration submission. It might take me a couple of hours or (sometimes) even days to get back to you, so please be patient.

In addition to this, you'll receive instructions to prepare your machine, as well as a link to the Zoom session for the workshop, approximately one week before the workshop date.

I'm looking forward to welcoming you in one or more of these workshops!
