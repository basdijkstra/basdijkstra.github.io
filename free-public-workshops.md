You can use the below form to register for any of my upcoming free, hands-on workshops.

All workshops will **start at 3 PM CEST** and will run for **3 hours**.  

If you have any questions prior to registering for a workshop, please email bas@ontestautomation.com.

Please only register for a workshop if you intend to attend the session and actively participate in the exercises and discussions.  

When registered, you'll receive instructions to prepare your machine approximately one week before the workshop date.
