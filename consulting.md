Is your team or organization thinking about introducing test automation as a means of performing specific testing tasks more efficiently? Do you feel that your current test automation efforts do not live up to their potential?

I have more than 16 years of experience in designing and implementing test automation solutions that work, with a wide range of clients in various fields in the Netherlands as well as abroad. Over the years, I've:

* helped clients get unstuck in their test automation efforts through assessments and coaching
* implemented test automation strategies that are efficient and agile for teams and entire organizations
* built test automation solutions that work from scratch and taught teams and organizations how to do the same

One of my strongest qualities is the ability to break seemingly difficult problems down into small, actionable tasks. I communicate effectively across the organization, from boardroom to team room.
