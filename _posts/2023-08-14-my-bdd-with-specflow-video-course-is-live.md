In October of last year, I met [Andrew Knight](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-leland-knight){:target="_blank"} at the 2022 AutomationSTAR conference in Munich. It was great to finally meet him in person, and during one of our chats, he asked me if I'd be interested in creating another video course for the [Test Automation University](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/){:target="_blank"} platform.

I'd already done [one on REST Assured](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/automating-your-api-tests-with-rest-assured/index.html){:target="_blank"} back in 2019, so I knew what I signed up for... Through creating that course, I learned that doing video is hard work, and that it takes a lot of time to do it well, so I wasn't immediately jumping at the opportunity.

However, when Andy said he was specifically looking for a course on BDD with [SpecFlow](https://specflow.org/){:target="_blank"}, I knew I had to say 'yes', simply because

* I love SpecFlow and know the people behind SpecFlow quite well, and it is a tool that I think deserves more attention
* I think there are a lot of courses (and a lot of content in general) out there that don't do justice to SpecFlow and to BDD in general  

So, while the title of the course would have 'SpecFlow' in it, I proposed that we didn't just focus on SpecFlow as a tool, but also take the time to explain the process of BDD in general and how SpecFlow (and other tools) fit in there.

It has taken me much longer to create the videos for the course than I expected, and I can really only thank Andy for being patient with me for the months I went over the initial deadline.

But, the good news is: the course is live and available for all to enjoy and learn from.

And, as with all Test Automation University courses: it is completely FREE.

I'm really, really happy with how the course turned out, and thanks once again to the Applitools team for giving me the opportunity to do this, and for making it look as good as it does.

You can find the course at [https://testautomationu.applitools.com/bdd-with-specflow/](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/bdd-with-specflow/){:target="_blank"}

I would love to hear what you think!
