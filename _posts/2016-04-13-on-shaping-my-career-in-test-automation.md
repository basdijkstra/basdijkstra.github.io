No in-depth technical post from me this week, but rather something that has been on my mind for a while. It&#8217;s still very much test automation-related, though.

I&#8217;ve been in the testing and test automation field for the last ten years now, and with the exception of a couple of smaller side projects, most of that time has been spent doing work that is billed by the hour. The first eight years I&#8217;ve done this while serving an employer, the last year and a half as a freelancer. However, I&#8217;m not too sure that I want to keep doing hourly billed work for the rest of my active career, and possibly not even for another five years or so. Instead, I&#8217;d like to transition to a professional career that is built on doing short and longer term projects that are compensated based on the value that I provide, not on the amount of hours I put in.

**But why?**  
The desire to make this transition is fueled by a multitude of reasons:

  * I want to be able to schedule my own time, rather than being tied to my clients&#8217; office hours. Not everybody works most effectively exactly between nine and five on weekdays, so why stick to that schedule when your output can be much higher if you&#8217;re able to set your own hours?
  * The ability to work on multiple projects in parallel. Working on a presentation for client B or a personal blog post while being in the office of client A can be much frowned upon, even if you&#8217;re still meeting or exceeding client A&#8217;s expectations. And to some extent, client A is right to expect you to work on their projects while you&#8217;re in their office, consuming their coffee.
  * Not being tied to a specific client location. Even though remote working facilities are abundant, especially when you&#8217;re part of a scrum team, you&#8217;re expected to be in the office during at least the major part of working hours. However, I have two young boys, and I would like to be there for them and pick them up from the daycare every now and then. Also, I like going for a run during the daytime. This is pretty hard to do while being forced to be in an office for the better part of the working day. And I&#8217;m not even talking about the commute to get there..

**Benefits for clients**  
As I&#8217;m seeing it, moving away from the &#8216;billing by the hour&#8217; model is beneficial for clients as well as for consultants:

  * Fixed price, fixed result. The client knows beforehand what will be delivered and what the costs will be.
  * Higher consultant motivation. When a consultant is paid for the result delivered rather than for the time spent working (or &#8216;working&#8217;) towards that result, a client is bound to get a consultant that is truly motivated to get to the agreed result as soon as possible, since that will yield the highest effective hourly rate for the consultant.

**Some drawbacks of project-based billing**  
Of course, billing based on result rather than time spent on a client location isn&#8217;t perfect, otherwise wouldn&#8217;t everyone be doing it already?

  * There&#8217;s no direct presence on client location if the consultant is working remotely. While a lot of good things can come from the freedom to work whenever and wherever you want, working on site has its benefits as well. For example, it&#8217;s easier to pop round a coworker to ask a question or have a look at what he or she is doing. And don&#8217;t forget office cake!
  * Hourly billing gives consultants a steady stream of income. When you&#8217;re paid by the project, rather than by the hour, it can be hard to obtain a steady stream of income due to the &#8216;feast or famine&#8217; nature of project-based work. Sometimes you&#8217;ll be fully booked, to the point of having to turn down clients, while at other times work might be stretched thin or non-existent. Saving up for these times takes discipline!

**Is the test automation field suited for this type of work?**  
That&#8217;s the million dollar question right there, and the reason for me writing this blog post. I&#8217;ve been spending a lot of time lately wondering whether the test automation field is suited to project-based work. In my experience, a lot of clients wanting to take their test automation to the next level (which is the value proposition I use to advertise my services) just want someone working on site. I don&#8217;t know whether this is because they don&#8217;t trust consultants in general to deliver without some sort of supervision or because the work that needs to be done requires this physical presence..

Having said that, I can easily think of a list of test automation-related activities that can (and one that I think can&#8217;t) be formed into project-based work:

_Types of test automation consulting / work that I think can be done on a per-project basis:_

  * Developing and delivering workshops and courses on test automation-related topics
  * Doing paid public speaking (this might be hard to achieve though, unless you&#8217;re a well-established name in the field)
  * Doing fixed price test automation development or support, for instance based on a monthly retainer. It is very important to define the project boundaries though, or you might end up doing a lot of work for relatively little pay
  * Provide a subscription-based test automation service. This is an idea that is potentially very interesting, although I don&#8217;t have any concrete ideas for such a service as of yet.
  * Performing quick scans, proof of concepts, doing test tool selection, etc. In other words, doing projects with a fixed beginning and end that usually require a couple of days of work (with a maximum of a week or two).

_Types of test automation consulting / work that are far less suitable to be done on a per-project basis:_

  * Being &#8216;the test automation guy&#8217; in an Agile team or project. The very nature of Agile projects requires frequent meetings, the ability to discuss matters quick and often and sharing tasks required to finish a sprint or story. While this can be done remotely in theory (although I believe it&#8217;s next to impossible in practice), it&#8217;s hard to define the scope and duration of the work required and therefore it&#8217;s probably not a good fit for project-based billing.

**Your experiences**  
I&#8217;m pretty sure I want to move towards a career where I do project-based, time and location independent work within the test automation field. Do you think such a career can be created? Are you living this dream of mine already? Please share your story, either as a comment on this post or (if you don&#8217;t want it to be read by the rest of the world) via email at bas@ontestautomation.com. I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;m not the only test automation consultant aspiring a truly independent lifestyle..

Oh, and I am already familiar with the <a href="http://www.freelancetransformation.com/blog/podcast" target="_blank">Freelance Transformation Podcast</a> (which is an excellent resource, by the way!) and books by the likes of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/147891.Cal_Newport" target="_blank">Cal Newport</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3367145.Chris_Guillebeau" target="_blank">Chris Guillebeau</a>. Check them out if you haven&#8217;t already! I am looking for stories, suggestions and examples that are specific to the test automation field, though.

I&#8217;m looking to create a follow-up to this post in a year or so, hopefully filled to the brim with success stories!
