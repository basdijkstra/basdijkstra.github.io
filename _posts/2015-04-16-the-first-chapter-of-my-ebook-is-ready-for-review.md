It&#8217;s taken a while, but the first chapter of my (as of yet unnamed) ebook on open source Java test tools is ready for review. I invite you to read it and send me all kinds of comments, praise and criticism, either as a comment to this post or via email at bas@ontestautomation.com.

Please note that:

  * No formatting has been done except for the code snippets
  * The download links to the Eclipse code projects do not work yet

Again, all types of comments are appreciated. The first chapter of my ebook can be downloaded <a href="http://www.ontestautomation.com/ebook_files/essential_java_test_toolkit_first_chapter.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
