Hey all!

First of all, apologies for the lack of recent postings on this blog. I have been quite busy with my day job and haven&#8217;t had time to write new posts in a while. I definitely intend to get working on some new stuff soon enough, so please do keep posted.

It&#8217;s been great to see that even though I haven&#8217;t added any new posts in a while, questions on existing posts are still coming in quite regularly. This is a great motivator for me to keep working on this site, and yet another reason to get my lazy behind into gear and start working on new material.

One of the reasons I&#8217;ve been quite busy is the fact that I&#8217;ve been doing a couple of presentations at conferences here in the Netherlands, and I thought it would be nice to share these with you as well.

The first presentation I held in November at the Dutch Testing Conference. The presentation shows the case study for a project I&#8217;ve been working on for the last 8 months or so. In this project, we have successfully introduced service virtualization as a means to get rid of some major blockers in our test environment. Using virtualized services that emulate the behaviour of the dependencies that were causing trouble, we have been able to speed up the development and testing process significantly. Introducing SV has also been an enabler for test automation as well &#8211; as in: we couldn&#8217;t do test automation without these virtualized services.

I gave the second presentation at the first Continuous Delivery Conference, also here in the Netherlands. As you can guess from the name, this conference was more about Continuous Delivery, rather than just about testing. However, as our case study showed some pretty significant improvements in the CD area as well, we decided to present it there as well. I did this talk at the request of Parasoft.

Both conferences were great to attend, and especially the CD conference gave me a lot of inspiration for future work and areas to explore. It really showed that testing isn&#8217;t just an activity in itself anymore (if it ever has been), but it has become an integral part of a much larger story, that of continuously delivering high quality software at ever increasing pace. Very interesting to hear and see the perspectives of some of the inspirators in the CD field on this topic..
