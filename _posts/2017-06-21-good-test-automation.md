Good test automation&#8230;

  * Enhances testing instead of trying to replace it
  * Helps testers do their job, instead of trying to replace them
  * Is treated as a first class citizen software development project (including, but not limited to, proper planning, design and testing, as well as accounting for maintenance)
  * Goes beyond the programming of automated checks, if that helps the team
  * Is focused, informative, trustworthy and repeatable

How good is your automation?
