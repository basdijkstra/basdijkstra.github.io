Hi there,

just a quick post to ask for some help from you, my readers.

I have just started writing a short ebook, in which I will introduce a number of useful open source, Java-based testing tools. It will feature lots of code snippets and examples, some of them you might have seen on this site already, but also hopefully enough new material to keep all of you interested.

What I would like to ask you is:

> According to you, what are the tools that definitely need to be included in such an ebook?

I&#8217;ll probably focus on functional testing tools in the first version of this ebook, but any suggestion is highly appreciated.

I&#8217;m looking forward to your suggestions! Please post them as a comment to this post for all to see. I&#8217;ll get back to writing in the meantime.
