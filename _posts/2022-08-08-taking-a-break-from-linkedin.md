Ever since I first signed up for LinkedIn way back in 2007, I've been spending a lot of time on the platform, especially in the last couple of years. Posting, liking, commenting, I couldn't and can't seem to get enough of it. However, in the last year or so, I've started to notice that my attitude towards LinkedIn has changed, and where I used to absolutely love LinkedIn, it has evolved into what can only be described as a love-hate relationship.

I still love LinkedIn for all the opportunities it has given me, the genuine connections I've made and the things I've learned from others posting on there. I'd even go as far as saying I wouldn't be where I am now in my career were it not for LinkedIn and the opportunities that have come through my network on there.

On the other hand, there's a couple of things on LinkedIn that I've grown to dislike, and they seem to be slowly turning the scales to the platform and my activity on there becoming a net-negative instead of a net-positive for me.

First, the quality of the posts. Where my feed used to be overwhelmingly professional and posts were mostly related to software testing, software development and everything that goes with it, these days I'm seeing a lot of other stuff on there that might be relevant for some people, but definitely not for me.

Political views. Personal stuff that is nowhere nearly related to what you do for a living. Endless 'discussion' (bashing, more like) of things that were beaten to death ages ago. And most of all, the neverending stream of self-important humblebragging. Yes, I've definitely been guilty of doing that myself as well. I'm no saint, but I'm tired of it, anyway.

As a result, watching my feed has become incredibly exhausting. But Bas, you might say, why don't you just check it less often? That's where the second thing I've grown to dislike comes in, and it is probably a much bigger dislike than the first one.

While LinkedIn is definitely much more business-oriented than, for example, Twitter, which [I left a couple of years ago](/on-quitting-twitter-and-looking-forward/), it _is_ a social media platform, carefully engineered to keep people interacting with it as long and as often as possible. When you start looking for the effect of social media on your brain, you'll find a lot of articles that tell you exactly this: [you didn't lose your attention, it was stolen from you](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/02/attention-span-focus-screens-apps-smartphones-social-media){:target="_blank"}.

And big tech must be doing something right (at least, regarding their own interests), because I spend a lot more time than I should on LinkedIn, time that I suspect I can put to much better use.

Having read a lot of articles about people struggling with and quitting social media ([here](https://www.circeinstitute.org/blog/all-or-nothing-why-i-quit-social-media){:target="_blank"} [are](https://haiderfromcosy.medium.com/permanently-deleting-social-media-changed-my-life-5dba4e183a9d){:target="_blank"} [some](https://durmonski.com/life-advice/why-i-quit-social-media/){:target="_blank"} [examples](https://thetech.com/2021/11/09/why-time-to-leave-social-media){:target="_blank"}) and recognizing myself a lot in the symptoms described in there, I've come to realize that something needs to change.

That's why I've decided to take a break from LinkedIn, too, at least for a while. I don't want to give it up altogether (at least not yet...) like I did with Twitter, especially because again, I have been getting a lot of value out of the platform over the years. I do want to see how much of that is directly related to me being on LinkedIn, though, and how much of that is purely because of the quality of my talks, my articles and my courses.

Call it an attempt to reset the way I use the platform.

I will check in once a week, on Friday mornings, to see if I've got any messages that absolutely need to be dealt with. I will also occasionally add posts (using [an external service](https://later.com/){:target="_blank"}), but only to point people to new content that I've produced, be it a blog post, a video or even a new [open source workshop](/open-source-workshops.md).

Apart from that, from today, **August 8, 2022**, I'll stay away from LinkedIn **until at least October 1, 2022**, and who knows how much longer.

As I said, I will use the time and headspace this brings to produce more valuable content, instead. Blogs, talks, new courses and workshops, ... I think there's a lot more value in that than in writing social media updates and comments that are inherently much more ephemeral in nature.

I also hope that this break will give me more time and the attention required to focus on some goals outside of work. I do read quite a lot of books already, but most of the time I stick with the 'lighter' stuff because I just don't seem to possess the attention span required for reading and processing more demanding literature anymore, and that's something I would like to change.

I'm also hoping to finally get enough training in to be able to run a marathon in 2023, and I've even set my eyes on one or two races that go slightly beyond that. Needless to say, that training for these things will take a significant amount of time, but it will also require both focus and proper sleep, two things that for me easily deteriorate if I spend too much time and mental energy on attention black holes such as LinkedIn.

I'm definitely not going to disappear from the planet, or even from the Internet, so if you want to get or stay in touch, I'd like to ask you to email me instead (bas@ontestautomation.com). I am more than happy to discuss opportunities for collaboration, or even just to have a chat.

If necessary, I might even give you my telephone number so you can text me, or so that we can have an actual call. Old-fashioned, I know, but much more personal, too.



I'm really looking forward to regaining my focus and ease of mind. Cheers!
