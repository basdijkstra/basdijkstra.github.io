I don't particularly like New Year's resolutions, but I'm going to write about one anyway, one concerning my LinkedIn usage. I've been spending a lot of time on that platform, especially in the last couple of years, and I've come to realize I have built up a love-hate relationship with it.

I love it for all the opportunities it has given me, the connections I've made and the things I've learned from others posting on there. I think it's safe to say I wouldn't be where I am now were it not for LinkedIn and the opportunities coming through my network on there.

On the other hand, there's a couple of things on LinkedIn that I've grown to dislike.

First, the quality of the posts. Where my feed used to be overwhelmingly professional and posts were mostly related to software testing, software development and everything that goes with it, these days I'm seeing a lot of other stuff on there that might be relevant for some people, but definitely not for me.

Second, while LinkedIn is definitely much more business-oriented than, for example, Twitter, which [I left a couple of years ago](/on-quitting-twitter-and-looking-forward/), it _is_ a social media platform, carefully engineered to keep people interacting with it as long and as often as possible.

And they must be doing something right, because I spend a lot more time than I should on LinkedIn, time that I suspect I can put to much better use, especially now that I've got a lot of new responsibilities.

That's why I've decided to take a break from LinkedIn, too, at least for a while. I don't want to give it up altogether (at least not yet...) like I did with Twitter, especially because again, I have been getting a lot of value out of the platform over the years.

I do want to see how much of that is directly related to me being on LinkedIn, though, and how much of that is purely because of the quality of my talks, my articles and my courses.

Call it an attempt to reset the way I use the platform.

I'm looking forward to not having to think about what to post for a while. It might even be for good, I don't know, but my mind definitely needs a long break from the digital stage and the near-constant performing known as maintaining a LinkedIn presence.

I might sporadically check in to see if I've got any messages that need to be dealt with (say once every two weeks or so). I will also keep adding posts on the [Inspired Academy](https://www.inspiredtesting.com/academy){:target="_blank"} page, linking to interesting articles, videos or other content related to software testing and automation.

Apart from that, I'll stay away from LinkedIn until at least February 1st, and who knows how much longer.

I'll use the time and headspace that brings to produce more valuable content, instead. Blogs, talks, an ebook I've been meaning to finish for a while... I think there's a lot more value in that than in posting updates and comments that are inherently much more ephemeral in nature.

I've also got an exam coming up in January that I need time and attention to study for (something not related to IT). Oh, and I also want to learn more about COBOL (yes, COBOL) in 2022, so I have plenty of goals to work towards in the time I hope to win this way.  

If you want to get or stay in touch, I'd like to ask you to email me instead (bdijkstra@inspiredtesting.com), or give me a call. Old-fashioned, I know, but much more personal, too. In the meantime, I'll be working on adding more value to the Inspired Academy, our clients, and the global software testing community.

_Update (January 26): for various reasons I failed to properly disconnect from LinkedIn for the month of January, but the last couple of weeks have made it even clearer that I do need a disconnect._

_The quality of my feed has been going down for a while, and it has reached a critical point where this, together with the constant humblebragging (something I've been and still am guilty of that myself, too), has gotten to the point where I feel I'm better off without it for an extended period of time._

_I will therefore (re-)start the break properly as of today, which means that until **at least** March 1st, I'll only share essential company updates and respond to direct messages where necessary. Other than that, it's no LinkedIn for me._

_Update (January 29): After having given this some more thought over the last couple of days, I've come to realize I probably need an even longer break. I'm honestly quite sick of the fake self-importance that is on constant display on LinkedIn (again, I'm very much guilty of that myself, too)._

_I'm therefore going to extend my break to **May 1st**, i.e., I'll take a 3-month break, and really get back to email, text and phone communication only. Very 90s. I'm loving it already._

_Update (February 6): This week only provided more proof that taking a LinkedIn break is the best (and possibly only) thing to do right now. I'll be focusing instead on doing more and better '[deep work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work){:target="_blank"}', writing blogs, articles and the ebook I referred to earlier, as well as improving my course content and delivering it to our clients._

_All updates you will see from me (and there will be very few) will be posted using an external service, relieving me from the need to actually visit LinkedIn._

_Update (February 26): I'm really enjoying this new way of (not) being on LinkedIn. I check messages and add connections once a week (Friday mornings), and other than that, I waste no time on the platform at all._

_This saves a lot of time and has significantly reduced distraction. I've already written two blog posts again and have produced quite a bit of other content as well. Will be sticking to this schedule for the coming months._
