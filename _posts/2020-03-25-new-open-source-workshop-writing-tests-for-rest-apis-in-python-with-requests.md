Just a quick update to let you all know that I've just released the first version of a brand new [open source workshop](https://www.ontestautomation.com/open-source-workshops/).

If you're looking to learn how to write tests for RESTful APIs in Python using the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="requests (opens in a new tab)" href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/" target="_blank">requests</a> library, head on over to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="my GitHub page (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/basdijkstra/requests-workshop" target="_blank">my GitHub page</a> to find a free and open source workshop on this very topic.

So far, it contains five series of examples, exercises and the corresponding answers for you to try out. As with all the other open source workshops, you're absolutely free to use it in any way you want. Share it, teach it to others, discuss it with coworkers, whatever you like.

The only thing I'm asking you is to share your experiences with me. Is there anything missing? How did you use this workshop and what did you think?

Have fun and happy learning.
