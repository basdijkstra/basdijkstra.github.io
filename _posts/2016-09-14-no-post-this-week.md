The last week and a half I&#8217;ve been very busy in both my professional and my private life. I hope to write about the outcomes of the former in separate blog posts soon enough. Also, I&#8217;m changing projects again, which takes its time and energy too. Unfortunately, as a result, there won&#8217;t be a blog post from me this week. I&#8217;ll be back next Wednesday, promised.

In the meantime, please check out the links in my blog roll on the right. They are fantastic sources that are updated weekly by people working very hard to gather everything interesting there is to read in the testing and test automation space.

See you next week.
