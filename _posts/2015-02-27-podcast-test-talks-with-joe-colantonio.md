While browsing the Internet for news and interesting articles on trends in test automation this week, I stumbled across <a href="http://www.testtalks.com" target="_blank">Test Talks</a>, a podcast on testing and test automation hosted by Joe Colantonio. Since then, I have listened to a couple of episodes during my daily commute, and so far, I&#8217;m enjoying it very much. Joe describes his podcast on his website as follows:

> TestTalks is a weekly podcast hosted by Joe Colantonio, which geeks out on all things software test automation. TestTalks covers news found in the testing space, reviews books about automation and speaks with some of the thought leaders in the test automation field. We’ll aim to interview some of today’s most successful and inspiring software engineers.
> 
> During the interviews, the spotlighted engineer will tell us about his or her testing experience, sharing their successes and failures as well as which testing techniques are working for them right now. We’ll all learn more about testing through these talks — hence the name TestTalks.

This description really sums it up very well. The episodes I have listened to so far feature in-depth interviews with some interesting people in the testing and test automation world, such as Matt Wynne (author of <a href="www.amazon.com/Cucumber-Book-Behaviour-Driven-Development-Programmers/dp/1934356808/" target="_blank">The Cucumber Book</a>) and Rosie Sherry (founder of the <a href="http://www.softwaretestingclub.com" target="_blank">Software Testing Club</a>). It covers subjects ranging from API testing via building robust Selenium frameworks to Agile and the role of test automation therein. Exactly the type of topics I am interested in. I&#8217;ll definitely try and catch up with all past episodes in the weeks to come.

So, for those of you looking for an interesting podcast on the subjects that I write about at ontestautomation.com, definitely check out Test Talks.
