Ever since I started running training sessions some 6-7 years ago, I've been receiving requests from individuals for training, requests that I simply could not fulfill, mostly because I'm simply too lazy to organize paid public training courses.

On the other hand, as you might know, I'm a big believer in live, in person training as opposed to self-paced consumption of training materials, and I'd love to give more people access to what I think is good quality training material.

This is where my latest initiative comes in: free, live, online workshops.

[Go to the workshop registration page](/free-public-workshops/)

### Why?
There are several reasons I decided to give this a try:

* _Giving back to the community_: As I said, there's plenty of people that simply aren't able to work with me in [regular training courses](/training/), mostly because of budgetary reasons. I want to give these people the opportunity to attend my workshops, too.
* _Marketing my services_: I feel this is a great way to give people, teams and organizations a free sample of my content and my training style, and I hope this will lead to more organizations contacting me for in-company training.
* _Trying out new material_: These free workshops are a great way for me to experiment with new material, either running new exercises in an existing workshop or even running a completely new workshop for the first time.

### What?
So far, I've scheduled three workshops until the end of 2023. These are:

* _API testing in Java with REST Assured_, in which we'll cover the basics of API testing, writing checks against API responses in Java using [REST Assured](https://rest-assured.io/){:target="_blank"}, working with parameterized tests, (de-)serialization and more.
* _API mocking in Java with WireMock_, in which we'll cover the basics of API mocking, writing basic API mocks in Java using [WireMock](https://wiremock.org/){:target="_blank"}, different request matching strategies, adding state to your mocks, response templating and more.
* _Contract testing in Java with Pact_, in which we'll cover the basics of contract testing, the different types of contract testing, running consumer tests and verifying provider implementations using [Pact](https://docs.pact.io/){:target="_blank"}, using a Pact Broker to do so, and more.

If these are a success, I'll definitely schedule more workshops, covering different topics, using different programming languages in the future.

If you have a specific request for a workshop topic, please let me know via email: bas@ontestautomation.com, and I'll be happy to see what I can do.

### How?
All workshops will start on the scheduled dates from 3 PM CEST and will run for 3 hours. This timeslot has been chosen to allow people from around the world to participate.

The workshops will be run using Zoom. After registering, you will receive a confirmation email right away, and instructions to prepare your machine and the link to the Zoom session approximately a week before the workshop.

I haven't made a final decision yet, but chances are very high that the workshops **will not be recorded**. Again, I'm a big believer in the power of live and in-person training, and in my experience, watching a recording of a training session is simply way less effective than attending and participating live.

Are you interested? Feel free to go over to the [workshop registration page](/free-public-workshops/) and submit your registration right away. I am looking forward to welcoming you in one of my workshops.
