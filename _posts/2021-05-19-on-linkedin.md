_Note ahead: this is a much more personal blog post than the ones I'm usually writing on here. Feel free to not read ahead if you were expecting to read something related to test automation right now :)_

Almost two years ago, I stepped away from using Twitter, for reasons I've explained in [this blog post](https://www.ontestautomation.com/on-quitting-twitter-and-looking-forward/) back then. Looking back, I can definitely say that it has had a predominantly positive effect on my work and my personal wellbeing. I've been much less distracted since, and haven't really experienced any negative side effects (well, maybe a missed cat meme or two, but I've come to accept that).

Over the last couple of months, though, I've felt that instead of putting the time I've gained by not frantically reading my Twitter feed to good use and create more valuable content, I've replaced it with spending just as much, if not more, time on LinkedIn. Gradually, I've slipped back into my bad habit of checking my profile many, many times a day for updates or other nuggets of information, often when I was bored or when I should have been working on more valuable things.

Last week, I spent a couple of days on a short holiday, and one of the things I did was re-read Cal Newport's book Digital Minimalism (LINK TO GOODREADS) for (I think) the fifth time. And this time, something clicked: I should probably spend a lot less time on LinkedIn as well and focus on creating content that is actually valuable, instead of writing short blurbs on what is essentially another social media platform and then frantically keep checking the amount of views, likes, comments and new connections that result from it.

Now, I've been on LinkedIn since about 2008 or so, and over the years, the platform has enabled me to get in touch with a lot of professionals from all around the world, and it has definitely played a major part in landing new consulting, training and public speaking gigs. Simply quitting LinkedIn altogether is therefore not something I want to do right now, but something definitely has to change in the way I use the platform (or how it uses me, to put it more accurately).

It doesn't help that over the years, LinkedIn has evolved from a very useful digital online rolodex of professional contacts into a social media platform that is just as eager as the others out there to keep you on their site as long as possible, and to gather as much data about you as they can so they can sell it to others. And that's all well and good, and I won't blame them for it, but it has been getting in the way of doing my best work way too often lately.

Also, I've been feeling that to get the most value out of LinkedIn, I've had to come up with new content all the time, only to remain visible on the platform. Too often I found myself thinking not 'what is the most valuable thing I can do right now', but 'what can I write or do that would be interesting for LinkedIn', instead. It started feeling like an act, a performance if you will.

So, something has to change, and I know from experience that simply saying 'I'll just use LinkedIn less' is not going to work for me. Instead, for at least the next six weeks, I'll not be using LinkedIn at all. Call it a 'mental reset' of sorts.

The time and focus that this reset will hopefully give me will be invested in creating more high-quality content that will actually help people become a better test automation engineer, instead of posting semi-motivational blurbs that might gather a few quick likes but don't have any long-lasting value. You probably know what I'm talking about, and yes, I've definitely been guilty of posting that kind of content myself..

This is not going to be an easy thing to do for me, and I'm sure I'll be tempted to sneakily log on to LinkedIn many times in the weeks to come, if only to see if there's something I'm missing, but I hope that urge disappears over time. Judging from what I've read in 'Digital Minimalism' and other books and articles I've read, it should get better after a week or two...

As I said, I hope to find the time and (especially) the focus to produce much more in depth, valuable content in the weeks to come, as well as give more time and attention to the much more important things in life: my family, or my newly found love of long-distance cycling.  

Of course, I'm still very happy to get in touch with you test automation engineers and other professionals, but LinkedIn probably isn't the best way to do so for the time being. I'm always happy to connect via email, so feel free to send me a message at bas@ontestautomation.com if you have a question, a proposal, an idea, something you'd like to share with me, or if you just want to say hi :)
