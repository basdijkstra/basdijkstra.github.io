On August 10th StickyMinds, a popular online community for software development professionals, published [an article I wrote](http://www.stickyminds.com/article/4-ways-boost-your-test-process-service-virtualization) titled &#8216;Four ways to boost your testing process with service virtualization&#8217;. In this article, I describe a case study from a project I worked on recently, where service virtualization was used to significantly improve the testing process.

The article demonstrates (as you can probably guess from the title) how you too can employ service virtualization to remove some of the bottlenecks associated with testing and test data and test environment management for distributed systems and development processes.

You can read the article by visiting the <a href="http://www.stickyminds.com/" target="_blank">StickyMinds</a> homepage now. The article will be right there on the front page.
