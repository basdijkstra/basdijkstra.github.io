Summer holidays.. A perfect time for taking a step or two back from work and reflect on what I&#8217;ve been doing this year, work-wise. Having just returned from my vacation, I can confirm that this year has been no different. One theme (or rather, one question) kept coming back over and over again this time:

> How do I go from being &#8216;good&#8217; to being &#8216;great&#8217;?

I consider myself to be a decent, sometimes maybe even a good consultant / writer / teacher / whatever it is I&#8217;m doing that day. While this is enough to be pretty fully booked at the moment, and even have the luxury of being able to say &#8216;no&#8217; to tasks or projects I don&#8217;t really want to take on, I feel I can do better in many ways. It doesn&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m failing, but there&#8217;s a lot of things that I feel I can improve.

Here&#8217;s a(n incomplete) list of things I&#8217;d like to accomplish on my journey from good to great:

  * Improving my consulting skills
  * Improving my public speaking skills
  * Improving my teaching skills
  * Improving my writing skills

These improvements would, in turn, hopefully lead to the following results (and who knows what else):

  * I&#8217;d like to grow a (small) back log of clients that I keep in close touch with and that I can help with their automation on a periodic basis, moving away from the hourly billing model towards a daily fee or a retainer
  * I&#8217;d like to speak at more conferences, and not just at testing conferences (no need for siloing knowledge sharing when the whole world seems to consist of multidisciplinary teams nowadays)
  * I&#8217;d love to get more bookings for my training and workshop offerings
  * I&#8217;d like to write and publish a short (e)book containing my views on the test automation craft

Achieving these goals is only part of the story, though. What would happen if I accomplished the above tasks? Would I somehow automatically start to see myself as a great consultant, rather than &#8216;just&#8217; a good one? Being the cynical and self-criticizing b\*st\*rd that I can be, will I ever consider myself being more than half decent? I&#8217;m not exactly sure, but I&#8217;d like to think that hitting the above targets moves me in the right direction, at least.

One thing that struck me when reviewing the list, though, is that they&#8217;re all totally unrelated to getting more knowledgeable with regards to specific test automation tools. I just don&#8217;t think that that&#8217;s going to get me much closer to what I want to be. Of course, tools are important (no test automation without tools), but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s key to the step I want to take.

According to you, readers of this blog, how do you think one moves up from &#8216;good&#8217; to &#8216;great&#8217;? I&#8217;d love to see your input on this matter! In the meantime, I will start to reach out to people that I consider to be on the &#8216;great&#8217; level, see how they got to where they are now and what I can learn from them. Call it looking for a mentor (or two). In time, hopefully I can be a mentor myself. I&#8217;d love to be able to do that and teach others what I know.

If there&#8217;s one thing that my time off work has made me realize this year, though, it&#8217;s that there&#8217;s so, so many things that I don&#8217;t know or don&#8217;t master! I&#8217;m already looking forward to what the future will bring.
