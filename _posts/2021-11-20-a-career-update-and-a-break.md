It's been a few months (well, five and a half, to be more precise) since I've written anything about my career and the journey I'm on.. Things have changed quite a bit on the career front since I wrote [this](/some-thoughts-on-freelancing-working-from-home-and-next-steps-in-my-career/) back in June.

You might have seen this on LinkedIn already, but on September 1st, I joined [Inspired Testing](https://www.inspiredtesting.com){:target="_blank"} as the director of their Inspired Academy. In this role, I'm responsible for creating and delivering training opportunities in sofware testing and automation both for Inspired Testing employees as well as their global customer base.

So far, it has been quite the ride, but one I immensely enjoy. Having been a consultant and trainer for pretty much my entire career, there are a lot of things involved in creating and running a department like the Academy I've never done before. Working on things like marketing, resource planning and budgets are new for me, but I have to say that it is really interesting and that I'm definitely learning a lot these days.

I'm lucky to be working with a team of fantastic people, so that definitely makes things a lot easier. The fact that it's a very internationally oriented job (most of my coworkers and our clients are in South Africa, and we are expanding worldwide) definitely makes things a lot easier. I'm looking forward to meeting them in person as soon as Covid allows.

I do have less time for hands-on automation and tinkering with tools these days, but I make an effort to spend as much time as I can to get my hands dirty. I've done quite a few talks, such as [this one here](https://huddle.eurostarsoftwaretesting.com/resources/test-automation/who-tests-the-tests-mutation-testing/){:target="_blank"}, and webinars like [this one here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeAWDfxqD7g){:target="_blank"} recently, and especially those where I do get to do live coding are really enjoyable.

Just this week, we also launched four new courses at the Inspired Academy:

* [Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming](https://www.inspiredtesting.com/academy/introduction-to-programming-course){:target="_blank"}
* [Advanced Automation for Functional Testers](https://www.inspiredtesting.com/academy/advanced-automation-testing-course){:target="_blank"}
* [API Testing and Automation](https://www.inspiredtesting.com/academy/api-testing-course){:target="_blank"}
* [Behaviour-Driven Development](https://www.inspiredtesting.com/academy/behaviour-driven-development-bdd-course){:target="_blank"}

and there's more, much more to come. Me working at Inspired Testing now means that I'm no longer offering my courses through On Test Automation, but that doesn't change the fact that I'd be happy to discuss your training needs and see how we can help.

One thing that _is_ going to change, at least for the next couple of months, is my LinkedIn presence. I've been spending a lot of time on that platform, especially in the last couple of years, and I've realized I have built up a love-hate relationship with it.

I love it for all the opportunities it has given me, the connections I've made and the things I've learned from others posting on there. I think it's safe to say I wouldn't be where I am now were it not for LinkedIn and the opportunities coming through my network on there.

On the other hand, there's a couple of things on LinkedIn that I've grown to dislike.

First, the quality of the posts. Where my feed used to be overwhelmingly professional and posts were mostly related to software testing, software development and everything that goes with it, these days I'm seeing a lot of other stuff on there that might be relevant for some people, but definitely not for me.

Second, while LinkedIn is definitely much more business-oriented than, for example, Twitter, which [I left a couple of years ago](/on-quitting-twitter-and-looking-forward/), it _is_ a social media platform, carefully engineered to keep people interacting with it as long and as often as possible. And they must be doing something right, because I spend a lot more time than I should on LinkedIn, time that I suspect I can put to much better use, especially now that I've got a lot of new responsibilities.

That's why I've decided to take a break from LinkedIn, too, at least for a while. I don't want to give it up altogether like I did with Twitter, especially because again, I have been getting a lot of value out of the platform over the years. I do want to see how much of that is directly related to me being on LinkedIn, though, and how much of that is purely because of the quality of my talks, my articles and my courses.

Call it an attempt to reset the way I use the platform.

I'm looking forward to not having to think about what to post for a while. It might even be for good, I don't know, but my mind definitely needs a long break from the digital stage and the near-constant performing known as maintaining a LinkedIn presence.

I might sporadically check in to see if I've got any messages that need to be dealt with (say once every two weeks or so), but other than that, I'll not be using LinkedIn until at least mid January or so. I'll use the time and headspace that brings to produce more valuable content, instead. Blogs, talks, an ebook I've been meaning to finish for a while... I think there's a lot more value in that than in posting updates and comments that are inherently much more ephemeral in nature.

If you want to get or stay in touch, I'd like to ask you to send me an email instead (bdijkstra@inspiredtesting.com), or call me. Old-fashioned, I know, but much more personal, too. In the meantime, I'll be working on adding more value to the Inspired Academy, our clients, and the global software testing community.
