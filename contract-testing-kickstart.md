Next to running [workshops and training courses](/training/contract-testing/) on contract testing, I also help teams and organizations implement this integration testing technique.

A successful contract testing implementation requires not just a shift in test tooling, but also a different way of communication between different teams that want to test the integration of their respective products, components and services.

I have both led and supported contract testing implementations at various companies, and these projects have taught me what works and what doesn't, and what it takes to make your contract testing efforts a success.

To help your company set off on their contract testing journey in the right direction, too, I have created a contract testing kickstarter package.

### The contract testing kickstarter package

This contract testing kickstarter package I offer contains three stages.

First, we go through a **discovery stage**, where we have one or more meetings (in person or online) in which:

* we get to know each other
* I deliver a 90-minute introductory presentation and live demo to understand the concept of contract testing
* we assess your current integration testing challenges
* we determine potential directions for contract testing implementation, including identification of candidate integrations and the most suitable [contract testing approach](/approaches-to-contract-testing/)

This stage will take from 4 to maximum 8 hours of your time. We can organize these meetings to be held either on site or online.

Next, we schedule **three days of workshops and pair / ensemble programming sessions or hackathons** to implement contract tests for the candidate integration(s) we identified in the discovery stage.

The outcome of these sessions is an initial set of working contract tests, integrated in the build pipelines for both consumer and provider. In other words, our aim is to get to the Platinum level of [the Pact CI/CD setup guide](https://docs.pact.io/pact_nirvana){:target="_blank"} for these integrations. 

These hands-on sessions are facilitated by me, but the contract generation and contract verification tests will be built by the consumer and provider development teams themselves.

After these three days, we enter a **transition stage** where I am available for further pair programming sessions and support. The exact amount of hours we schedule in the transition stage is open for negotiation, but I recommend to go with 16 hours.

As a **bonus**, you will get free access to my [online contract testing video course](https://ontestautomation.teachable.com/p/practical-contract-testing-with-pact){:target="_blank"} for all participants. That's an added value of $129-$149 per person.

### Is this package a good fit for my organization?

If you:

* are a company considering adding contract testing to your testing and automation strategy
* feel that the time is right to stop talking and start doing
* need someone with experience to help you on your way

then this package deal is the right choice for you.

### What does this package cost?

Well, it depends, and it depends on a few specific factors to be precise:

* the amount of hours you are looking to spend in the transition phase of the kickstarter, and
* the location where we will run the workshops and pair / ensemble programming sessions or hackathons, because of cost of travel and accommodation

To give you an estimate, you should account for _somewhere between EUR 12,000 and EUR 18,000_, depending on your location, based on a transition stage duration of 16 hours. 

If you are interested in the contract testing kickstarter package, please contact me using the [contact form](/contact/) on this site, or email me at bas@ontestautomation.com to start the conversation. I'm looking forward to working with you and set you off on your contract testing journey in the right direction.
