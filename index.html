    <p>Hi, I'm Bas, and I've been working in test automation for about 17 years now. Most of that time I spent working as a test automation engineer, but these days I'm mostly active as a <a href="/consulting/">consultant</a> and <a href="/training/">trainer</a>.</p>
    <p>Next to my in-house consultancy and training services, I provide <a href="/free-public-workshops/">free online workshops</a> on various topics related to API testing and automation for individuals.</p>
    <p>I'm also dabbling in open-source software development, mainly in C#, and I'm the developer of <a href="https://github.com/basdijkstra/rest-assured-net" target="_blank">RestAssured.Net</a>, a library that strives to make writing tests for HTTP-based APIs in C# simple and fun.</p>
