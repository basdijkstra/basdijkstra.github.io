<p>Hi, I'm Bas Dijkstra, and I help companies improve their software testing efforts through smart application of tools.</p>

<p>I'm spending most of my days with companies around the world, teaching their engineers and other staff about a wide range of topics related to test automation.</p>

<p><b>If you want your team to level up their test automation knowledge as well, we should talk!</b></p>
