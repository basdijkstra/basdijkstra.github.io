Would you like to book me to do a virtual talk for your team or company?

Are you building a new test automation tool or platform, and would you like some honest feedback?

Do you have questions about your current test automation strategy, and would you like the unbiased opinion from an experienced third party?

You can book a paid 30-, 60- or 90-minute meeting with me using the buttons below. I'm looking forward to our conversation.

* Give you input on your test automation strategy and suggest steps to address pain points

When you book a 90-minute meeting with me, I can:

* Review your current test automation framework or tool stack and give you actionable suggestions for improvement, complete with examples

#### Terms and conditions

* Unhappy with the outcome of our conversation? I'm happy to give you a **full refund**, no questions asked
* All resources (slide decks, videos, code, ...) I use in our meeting are included in the price
* The meetings take place via Zoom, and they can be recorded and the recording shared with you on request
* If our conversation leads to further paid work with you or through you, I'll consider the payment for the meeting an advance on the payment for the work (i.e., the meeting is free in that case)
