Looking for a gift to say thanks? I appreciate a bottle of good whisk(e)y or bourbon.

Here are some of my favourite bottles that are widely available online, and probably also in a decent brick-and-mortar shop:

#### Under EUR 50(-ish)
* Arran 10 years
* Tomatin 12 years
* Auchentoshan Three Wood
* Aultmore 12 years Foggie Moss
* The Balvenie 12 years Double Wood
* Woodford Reserve Double Oaked (bourbon)

#### A little more expensive
* Arran 21 years
* ~~The Balvenie 14 years Caribbean Cask~~
* The Balvenie 15 years Madeira Cask

Whiskies that are struck through are ones that I have in my collection at the moment.
