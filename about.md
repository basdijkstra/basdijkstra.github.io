Hey, my name is Bas Dijkstra and I have been active in the test automation field for some 15 years now, first as an engineer, but these days mostly as a trainer and consultant.

Over the years, I've been working with a wide range of clients in the Netherlands as well as abroad. Initially, I was mostly responsible for creating, maintaining and extending test automation solutions, but nowadays I mostly focus on helping others (individuals, teams and organizations) improve their test automation skills and efforts.

I've delivered test automation [training]({% link training.md %}) to a wide range of companies and conference attendees in the Netherlands as well as abroad, to excellent reviews.

You can find more information about my professional life on my <a href="https://nl.linkedin.com/in/basdijkstra" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn profile</a>. For questions and more information you can use the [contact form]({% link contact.md %}) on this site, or send me an email at bas@ontestautomation.com.

I live in Amersfoort, The Netherlands, together with my wife and two sons. When I am not at work, I like to go on long distance bike rides or read a good book.
