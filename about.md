Hey, my name is Bas Dijkstra, and I am an independent test automation consultant and trainer.

I have been active in the test automation field for some 19 years now, and have worked on software testing and automation solutions across a wide range of programming languages, frameworks and technology stacks. 

I've delivered test automation [training](/training/) to dozens of companies and hundreds of conference attendees in the Netherlands as well as abroad, [to excellent reviews](/testimonials.md).

You can find a complete overview of my professional life on [my LinkedIn profile](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/basdijkstra/){:target="_blank"}. If you want to get in touch, please use the [contact form](/contact/) on this site, or email me at bas@ontestautomation.com.

I'm also the developer of [RestAssured.Net](https://github.com/basdijkstra/rest-assured-net/){:target="_blank"}, a library that is meant to make writing tests for HTTP APIs in C# a breeze.

I live in Amersfoort, The Netherlands, together with my wife and two sons. When I am not at work, I like to go outside for a long bike ride, or to sit down and read a good book.
