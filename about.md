Hey, my name is Bas Dijkstra, and I am an independent test automation consultant and trainer.

I have been active in the test automation field for some 16 years now, and have worked on software testing and automation solutions across a wide range of programming languages, frameworks and technology stacks. 

I've delivered test automation [training]({% link training.md %}) to dozens of companies and hundreds of conference attendees in the Netherlands as well as abroad, to excellent reviews.

You can find a complete overview of my professional life on my <a href="https://nl.linkedin.com/in/basdijkstra" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn profile</a>. If you want to get in touch, please use the [contact form]({% link contact.md %}) on this site, or send me an email at bas@ontestautomation.com.

I live in Amersfoort, The Netherlands, together with my wife and two sons. When I am not at work, I like to go outside for a long run, or to sit down and read a good book.
