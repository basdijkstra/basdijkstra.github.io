Hey, my name is Bas Dijkstra and I am a test automation trainer and developer.

I have been active in the test automation field for some 14 years now, first as an engineer, but these days mostly as a trainer, consultant and part-time software developer.

I've delivered test automation [training]({% link training.md %}) to a wide range of companies and conference attendees in the Netherlands as well as abroad, to excellent reviews.

You can find more information about my professional life on my <a href="https://nl.linkedin.com/in/basdijkstra" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn profile</a>. For questions and more information you can use the [contact form]({% link contact.md %}) on this site, or send me an email at bas@ontestautomation.com.

I live in Amersfoort, The Netherlands, together with my wife and two sons. When I am not at work, I like to go for a run, ride my bike or swim, read a good book and/or enjoy a dram of fine whisky.
