Hey, my name is Bas Dijkstra, and I am currently the Director of International Academy at [Inspired Testing](https://www.inspiredtesting.com){:target="_blank"}. Before joining them, I have been active in the test automation field for some 15 years now, first as an engineer, but more recently mostly as a trainer and consultant.

I've delivered test automation [training]({% link training.md %}) to a wide range of companies and conference attendees in the Netherlands as well as abroad, to excellent reviews.

You can find more information about my professional life on my <a href="https://nl.linkedin.com/in/basdijkstra" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn profile</a>. I'm not very active on there, [for personal reasons](/taking-a-break-from-linkedin/), so if you want to get in touch, I'd much prefer you use the [contact form]({% link contact.md %}) on this site, or send me an email at bas@ontestautomation.com.

I live in Amersfoort, The Netherlands, together with my wife and two sons. When I am not at work, I like to go on long distance bike rides or read a good book. I'm also exploring the fascinating world of whisky tasting, collecting and investing.
