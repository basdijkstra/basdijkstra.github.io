Hey, my name is Bas Dijkstra, and I am currently the Director at [Inspired Academy](https://www.inspiredtesting.com/academy){:target="_blank"}. In this role, I am responsible for creating and delivering training opportunities for Inspired Testing staff, as well as our global customer base.

Before starting this role, I have been active in the test automation field for some 15 years now, first as an engineer, but more recently mostly as a trainer and consultant.

I've delivered test automation [training]({% link training.md %}) to a wide range of companies and conference attendees in the Netherlands as well as abroad, to excellent reviews.

You can find a complete overview of professional life on my <a href="https://nl.linkedin.com/in/basdijkstra" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn profile</a>. If you want to get in touch, please use the [contact form]({% link contact.md %}) on this site, or send me an email at bas@ontestautomation.com.

I live in Amersfoort, The Netherlands, together with my wife and two sons. When I am not at work, I like to go outside for a run or a bike ride, or to read a good book.
