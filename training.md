## Valuable feedback, fast
If we want our test automation to deliver on the goal of providing valuable feedback, fast, we need to do more than throwing tools at testing problems.

We need to be able to identify and analyze (potential) problems and suggest, implement and assess solutions at both the technical and the procedural and organizational level.

The 'Valuable feedback, fast' course is designed to teach individuals, teams and organizations how to do exactly that.

## API testing and development
With software systems becoming ever more distributed, and APIs accounting for over 80% of all Internet traffic, every modern software tester should know how to work with APIs in their testing, as well as how to design, write and execute tests for APIs.

My API testing courses cover the broad spectrum that is API testing. I offer several modules that I can teach either individually, or bundled as a comprehensive API testing course:

<a href="/training/workshop-exploratory-api-testing/" class="btn btn--primary">Workshop exploratory API testing (0,5 - 1 day)</a>

<a href="/training/workshop-api-security-testing/" class="btn btn--primary">Workshop API security testing (0,5 - 1 day)</a>

<a href="/training/workshop-api-test-automation-in-code/" class="btn btn--primary">Workshop API test automation in code (0,5 - 1 day)</a>

<a href="/training/workshop-api-mocking-with-wiremock/" class="btn btn--primary">Workshop API mocking with WireMock (0,5 - 1 day)</a>

If your team is looking to get serious about API testing, I'm happy to have a conversation and create a course for you that fits your API testing learning requirements like a glove. 

If you want to learn what it takes to build and execute a solid API testing strategy from the ground up, working together as developers and testers, I offer a course on that, too:

<a href="/training/building-and-testing-an-api/" class="btn btn--primary">Building and testing an API (2-3 days)</a>

## Contract testing
When a software is made up out of services and components that are built, deployed and run independently, it can be hard to get an answer to the question of:

> Are all individual components and services able to communicate with one another?

Contract testing is a technique, supported by tools, that can help you find an answer to this question and deploy your services with confidence.

<a href="/training/contract-testing/" class="btn btn--primary">Contract testing workshop (1 day)</a>

If you prefer self-paced learning, I have also created a video course that you can enroll in. Learn more about contract testing in your own time, at your own pace!

## Playwright
<a href="https://playwright.dev">Playwright</a> has quickly become the test automation tool of choice for many companies. If your team or company wants to learn how to get started with Playwright, too, my introductory course will be a great fit:

<a href="/training/workshop-playwright/" class="btn btn--primary">Test automation with Playwright</a>

If you have some Playwright experience under your belt already, and you want to learn how to get more out of the library and improve your existing Playwright-based tests, I have just the course for that, too: 

<a href="/training/improving-your-playwright-code/" class="btn btn--primary">Improving your Playwright code</a>

Both courses can also be combined into a single, comprehensive Playwright course that'll teach you everything you need to know to become successful with your test automation in Playwright.

## Behaviour-Driven Development
Creating high quality software starts with a shared understanding between stakeholders about what that software is supposed to do. Behaviour-Driven Development or BDD is a popular technique to facilitate the creation of this shared understanding.

Unfortunately, BDD is still often misunderstood and badly implemented, leading to lots of time, effort and money wasted, without much to show for it.

In this course, you'll not only learn what the 'textbook' BDD process looks like, but you'll also learn about common BDD pitfalls and how to avoid them.  

<a href="/training/behaviour-driven-development/" class="btn btn--primary">Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) (1-2 days)</a>

## Miscellaneous workshops
These half- to full-day workshops are perfect if you're looking to get a kickstart with a new tool or technique. And if you're a conference organizer: these workshops work really well as part of conferences, too!

<a href="/training/mutation-testing/" class="btn btn--primary">Mutation testing workshop (half day)</a>

<a href="/training/improving-your-test-automation-code/" class="btn btn--primary">Improving your test automation code (1 day)</a>

<a href="/training/workshop-git-and-cicd/" class="btn btn--primary">Git and CI/CD with GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps (1 day)</a>

## Customization
Can't find the training course or workshop you were looking for? I am happy to talk to you to see if together, we can create a **bespoke training course** (or even a complete curriculum of courses) that fits your training needs like a glove.

Are you interested in having me as a trainer in your organization or at your conference? Feel free to email me at bas@ontestautomation.com, or use the contact form on [this page](/contact/).

I’m looking forward to helping you improve your test automation efforts!
