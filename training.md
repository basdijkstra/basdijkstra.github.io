Do you want to learn what it takes to become skilled in test automation? That's great, but please keep in mind that simply learning how to work with a tool or two is not enough to get there.

You'll need to learn fundamental software testing _and_ software development skills if you want to be a valuable and in-demand automation practitioner.

This is the reason that all of my training courses share a common fundamental trait:

>Principles and patterns over tools and tricks

I've been a practitioner in the test automation space since 2006 and have worked with a wide range of clients and tools, so I've seen what works and what doesn't.

I have delivered my training courses and workshops to many companies around the world, as well as at a range of internationally recognized conferences, to excellent reviews.

### <a name="courses"></a>Courses

##### Bootcamp for test automation engineers / SDETs
Over 18 years of working in the test automation space has taught me many, many things, and this bootcamp combines these lessons into a single, coherent course.

<a href="/training/test-automation-bootcamp/" class="btn btn--primary">Test automation bootcamp (5 days)</a>

##### API testing and development
With software systems becoming ever more distributed, every modern software tester should know how to work with APIs in their testing, as well as how to design, write and execute tests for APIs.

I have created a number of workshops that cover various aspects of API testing.

<a href="/training/workshop-exploratory-api-testing/" class="btn btn--primary">Workshop exploratory API testing (0,5 - 1 day)</a>

<a href="/training/workshop-api-security-testing/" class="btn btn--primary">Workshop API security testing (0,5 - 1 day)</a>

<a href="/training/workshop-api-test-automation-in-code/" class="btn btn--primary">Workshop API test automation in code (0,5 - 1 day)</a>

<a href="/training/workshop-api-mocking-with-wiremock/" class="btn btn--primary">Workshop API mocking with WireMock (0,5 - 1 day)</a>

To learn more about building a solid API testing strategy from the ground up, working together as developers and testers, this training course is a great fit:

<a href="/training/building-and-testing-an-api/" class="btn btn--primary">Building and testing an API (2-3 days)</a>

##### Contract testing
With the rise of distributed and microservices-based software systems, the challenge of performing efficient integration testing early and often in the SDLC is becoming ever more difficult to tackle.

Contract testing is an approach that is quickly gaining traction as a way out of 'integration testing hell'. In this practical and very hands-on training, you'll learn everything you need to know to make your contract testing efforts successful.

##### Improving your test automation code

While there are many test automation solutions out there promising that 'everybody can write tests with our tool', knowing how to build maintainable scalable test automation solutions requires a healthy dose of fundamental object-oriented programming skills.

In this course, we'll go through many fundamental programming principles, and you'll learn when and how to apply them to your advantage when writing test code, but also when writing application code or discussing that application code with a fellow developer.  

<a href="/training/improving-your-test-automation-code/" class="btn btn--primary">Applying programming principles in test automation (1 day)</a>

##### Behaviour-Driven Development
Creating high quality software starts with a shared understanding between stakeholders about what that software is supposed to do. Behaviour-Driven Development or BDD is a popular technique to facilitate the creation of this shared understanding.

Unfortunately, BDD is still often misunderstood and badly implemented, leading to lots of time, effort and money wasted, without much to show for it.

In this course, you'll not only learn what the 'textbook' BDD process looks like, but you'll also learn about common BDD pitfalls and how to avoid them.  

<a href="/training/behaviour-driven-development/" class="btn btn--primary">Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) (2 days)</a>

##### Workshops
These half- to full-day workshops are perfect if you're looking to get a kickstart with a new tool or technique. And if you're a conference organizer: these workshops work really well as part of conferences, too!

<a href="/training/workshop-playwright/" class="btn btn--primary">Test automation with Playwright</a>

<a href="/training/workshop-git-and-cicd/" class="btn btn--primary">Git and CI/CD with GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps</a>

<a href="/training/mutation-testing/" class="btn btn--primary">Mutation testing</a>

##### Customization
Can't find the training course or workshop you were looking for? I am happy to talk to you to see if together, we can create a **bespoke training course** (or even a complete curriculum of courses) that fits your training needs like a glove.

Are you interested in having me as a trainer in your organization or at your conference? Feel free to email me at bas@ontestautomation.com, or use the contact form on [this page](/contact/).

Iâ€™m looking forward to helping you improve your test automation efforts!


### <a name="testimonials"></a>Testimonials

_"I really enjoyed this course. I thought it was extremely valuable to have Bas there to answer questions and expand on his slides. One of the harder parts of learning material like this online through a youtube video for instance, is that you don't have anyone to bounce ideas off of really. This course not only let us bounce ideas off each other, but we could then confirm those with Bas. I hope we do more of these in the future."_

_"Bas pretty much set the pace based on those in attendance. It was a conversation between all of us more than him lecturing and us listening. If we had questions during his presentation of material or during our hands on time, he was more than happy to assist. I felt he wanted to be sure we understood the content before moving on to something else. I also appreciated that he wanted to work around how we tested, what tools we use and our general level of experience as we progressed through the workshop."_

_"All in all, this was a fantastic workshop. Though I am still very much a novice when it comes to API testing, I feel as though the past few weeks have set me on a much better course of learning and practicing this type of testing. It is definitely something I want to become more proficient in, and I really have to make it a point to spend time studying and practicing MUCH more often."_
