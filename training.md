Valuable automation training is more than just teaching people to perform tricks with tools. I've been a practitioner in the test automation space since 2006 and have worked with a wide range of clients and tools, so I've seen what works and what doesn't. 

This experience has enabled me to build a solid portfolio of test automation training courses and workshops, which I have delivered to many companies in the Netherlands as well as abroad, to excellent reviews.
