Do you want to learn what it takes to become skilled in test automation? That's great, but please keep in mind that simply learning how to work with a tool or two is not enough to get there.

You'll need to learn fundamental software testing _and_ software development skills if you want to be a valuable and in-demand automation practitioner.

This is the reason that all of my training courses share a common fundamental trait:

>Principles and patterns over tools and tricks

I've been a practitioner in the test automation space since 2006 and have worked with a wide range of clients and tools, so I've seen what works and what doesn't.

I have delivered my training courses and workshops to many companies around the world, as well as at a range of internationally recognized conferences, to excellent reviews.

##### API testing
With software systems becoming ever more distributed, every modern software tester should know how to work with APIs in their testing, as well as how to design, write and execute tests for APIs.

I have created a number of workshops that cover various aspects of API testing.

As with any type of testing, learning API testing should start with learning how to perform exploratory testing on your APIs:

<a href="/training/workshop-exploratory-api-testing/" class="btn btn--primary">Workshop exploratory API testing (0,5 - 1 day)</a>

If you are looking to learn more about testing the security of your APIs, specifically, this is just the workshop for you:

<a href="/training/workshop-api-security-testing/" class="btn btn--primary">Workshop API security testing (0,5 - 1 day)</a>

The above workshops are all part of my popular API testing masterclass course, which covers a wide range of techniques related to API testing: 

<a href="/training/api-testing-masterclass/" class="btn btn--primary">API testing masterclass (3 days)</a>

##### Object-oriented programming principles
We've all heard it before: test automation is software development. And it's true: if you want to write automation that is structured well enough to be readable and maintainable, you will need object-oriented programming skills.

In this course, we'll cover everything from writing and running your first code to applying fundamental object-oriented programming principles to your code.

<a href="/training/oop-for-testers/" class="btn btn--primary">Object-oriented programming principles (3 days)</a>

##### Contract testing
With the rise of distributed and microservices-based software systems, the challenge of performing efficient integration testing early and often in the SDLC is becoming ever more difficult to tackle.

Contract testing is an approach that is quickly gaining traction as a way out of 'integration testing hell'. In this practical and very hands-on training, you'll learn everything you need to know to make your contract testing efforts successful.

<a href="/training/contract-testing/" class="btn btn--primary">Contract testing (1 day)</a>

##### Behaviour-Driven Development
Creating high quality software starts with a shared understanding between stakeholders about what that software is supposed to do. Behaviour-Driven Development or BDD is a popular technique to facilitate the creation of this shared understanding.

Unfortunately, BDD is still often misunderstood and badly implemented, leading to lots of time, effort and money wasted, without much to show for it.

In this course, you'll not only learn what the 'textbook' BDD process looks like, but you'll also learn about common BDD pitfalls and how to avoid them.  

<a href="/training/behaviour-driven-development/" class="btn btn--primary">Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) (2 days)</a>

##### Workshops
These half- to full-day workshops are perfect if you're looking to get a kickstart with a new tool or technique. And if you're a conference organizer: these workshops work really well as part of conferences, too!

<a href="/training/improving-your-test-automation-code/" class="btn btn--primary">Improving your test automation code</a>

<a href="/training/workshop-git-and-cicd-with-github-actions/" class="btn btn--primary">Git and CI/CD with GitHub Actions</a>

<a href="/training/mutation-testing/" class="btn btn--primary">Mutation testing</a>

##### Customization
Can't find the training course or workshop you were looking for? I am happy to talk to you to see if together, we can create a **bespoke training course** (or even a complete curriculum of courses) that fits your training needs like a glove.

Other topics I've frequently covered in training courses include Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD), UI automation with Selenium WebDriver, mutation testing and Robot Framework.

Are you interested in having me as a trainer in your organization or at your conference? Feel free to email me at bas@ontestautomation.com, or use the contact form on [this page](/contact/).

Iâ€™m looking forward to helping you improve your test automation efforts!


### <a name="testimonials"></a>Testimonials

_"I really enjoyed this course. I thought it was extremely valuable to have Bas there to answer questions and expand on his slides. One of the harder parts of learning material like this online through a youtube video for instance, is that you don't have anyone to bounce ideas off of really. This course not only let us bounce ideas off each other, but we could then confirm those with Bas. I hope we do more of these in the future."_

_"Bas pretty much set the pace based on those in attendance. It was a conversation between all of us more than him lecturing and us listening. If we had questions during his presentation of material or during our hands on time, he was more than happy to assist. I felt he wanted to be sure we understood the content before moving on to something else. I also appreciated that he wanted to work around how we tested, what tools we use and our general level of experience as we progressed through the workshop."_

_"All in all, this was a fantastic workshop. Though I am still very much a novice when it comes to API testing, I feel as though the past few weeks have set me on a much better course of learning and practicing this type of testing. It is definitely something I want to become more proficient in, and I really have to make it a point to spend time studying and practicing MUCH more often."_
