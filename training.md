Valuable automation training is more than just teaching people to perform tricks with tools. I've been a practitioner in the test automation space since 2006 and have worked with a wide range of clients and tools, so I've seen what works and what doesn't. 

This experience has enabled me to build a solid portfolio of test automation training courses and workshops, which I have delivered to many companies in the Netherlands as well as abroad, to excellent reviews.

### _**API testing**_

Every tester should know how to work with APIs in their testing, as well as how to design, write and execute tests for APIs. This masterclass is just for you.

### _**Tool workshops**_

These half-day workshops are perfect if you're looking to get a kickstart with a new tool or technique. And if you're a conference organizer: these workshops work really well as part of conferences, too!

Can't find the training course you were looking for? I am happy to talk to you to see if together, we can create a **bespoke training course** (or even a complete curriculum of courses) that fits your training needs like a glove.

Are you interested in having me as a trainer in your organization or at your conference? Feel free to email me at bas@ontestautomation.com, or use the contact form on [this page](/contact/).

Iâ€™m looking forward to helping you improve your test automation efforts!
