Solid automation training is more than just teaching people to perform tricks with tools. Through years of experience as a trainer in the test automation space, I&#8217;ve managed to build a solid portfolio of test automation training courses and workshops.

### **_Automation concepts, principles and strategy_**

No matter if you&#8217;re a CEO or an engineer, you&#8217;ll need a solid strategy before starting your test automation efforts. No 40+ page documents necessary.

### **_Software development for testers_**

Test automation is software development. These courses will teach you everything you need to know to start creating automated tests in various programming languages.

### _**API testing**_

Every tester should know how to work with APIs in their testing, as well as how to design, write and execute tests for APIs. This masterclass is just for you.

### **_Behaviour Driven Development_**

There&#8217;s more to BDD than just using Cucumber. Much more. For a complete introduction to Behaviour Driven Development, look no further.

### _**Tool workshops**_

These half-day workshops are perfect if you&#8217;re looking to get a kickstart with a new tool or technique. And if you&#8217;re a conference organizer: these workshops work really well as part of conferences, too!

Couldn&#8217;t find the training course you were looking for? I am happy to talk to you to see if together, we can create a **bespoke training course** (or even a complete curriculum of courses) that fits your training needs like a glove.

Are you interested in having me as a trainer in your organization or at your conference? Feel free to send me an email at bas@ontestautomation.com, or use the contact form on [this page](https://www.ontestautomation.com/contact/).

Iâ€™m looking forward to help you improve your test automation efforts!
