Valuable automation training is more than just teaching people to perform tricks with tools. I've been a practitioner in the test automation space since 2006 and have worked with a wide range of clients and tools, so I've seen what works and what doesn't. 

This experience has enabled me to build solid test automation training courses and workshops, which I have delivered to many companies in the Netherlands as well as abroad, to excellent reviews.

### API testing
With software systems becoming ever more distributed, every modern software tester should know how to work with APIs in their testing, as well as how to design, write and execute tests for APIs.

This masterclass covers the entire spectrum of API testing and automation.

### Object-oriented programming
We've all heard it before: test automation is software development. And it's true: if you want to write automation that is structured well enough to be readable and maintainable, you will need object-oriented programming skills.

In this course, we'll cover everything from writing and running your first code to applying fundamental object-oriented programming principles.

### Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD)
Creating a shared understanding of the way software should behave is essential in preventing software defects caused by miscommunication, misinformation and misinterpretation. This is the exact premise of BDD.  

In this practical and hands-on BDD training, you'll learn that BDD is more than sticking Cucumber or SpecFlow on top of your existing automation. Much more!

### Workshops
These half- to full-day workshops are perfect if you're looking to get a kickstart with a new tool or technique. And if you're a conference organizer: these workshops work really well as part of conferences, too!

Can't find the training course you were looking for? I am happy to talk to you to see if together, we can create a **bespoke training course** (or even a complete curriculum of courses) that fits your training needs like a glove.

Are you interested in having me as a trainer in your organization or at your conference? Feel free to email me at bas@ontestautomation.com, or use the contact form on [this page](/contact/).

Iâ€™m looking forward to helping you improve your test automation efforts!
