Solid automation training is more than just teaching people to perform tricks with tools. Through years of experience as a trainer in the test automation space, I've managed to build a solid portfolio of test automation training courses and workshops.

### **_Automation concepts, principles and strategy_**

No matter if you're a CEO or an engineer, you'll need a solid strategy before starting your test automation efforts. No 40+ page documents necessary.

| Course name | Duration |    |
|-------------|----------|----|
| Introduction to test automation | 1 day | [more information](/training/introduction-to-test-automation/) |

### **_Software development for testers_**

Test automation is software development. These courses will teach you everything you need to know to start creating automated tests in various programming languages.

| Course name | Duration |    |
|-------------|----------|----|
| Python for testers | 3 days | [more information](/training/python-for-testers/) |
| Java for testers | 3 days | [more information](/training/java-for-testers/) |
| C# for testers | 3 days | [more information](/training/csharp-for-testers/) |

### _**API testing**_

Every tester should know how to work with APIs in their testing, as well as how to design, write and execute tests for APIs. This masterclass is just for you.

| Course name | Duration |    |
|-------------|----------|----|
| API testing masterclass | 3 days | [more information](/training/api-testing-masterclass/) |

There's more to BDD than just using Cucumber. Much more. For a complete introduction to Behaviour Driven Development, look no further.

### _**Tool workshops**_

These half-day workshops are perfect if you're looking to get a kickstart with a new tool or technique. And if you're a conference organizer: these workshops work really well as part of conferences, too!

| Course name |  Language |   |
|-------------|----------|---|
| Getting started with Consumer Driven Contract Testing | Java, C#, JavaScript, Python, Go (all using Pact) | [more information](/training/getting-started-with-consumer-driven-contract-testing/) |
| Automating your API tests | Java (REST Assured), C# (RestSharp), Python (requests), Go (resty) | [more information](/training/automating-your-api-tests/) |
| Service virtualization | Java (WireMock | [more information](/training/service-virtualization-with-wiremock/) |

Couldn't find the training course you were looking for? I am happy to talk to you to see if together, we can create a **bespoke training course** (or even a complete curriculum of courses) that fits your training needs like a glove.

Are you interested in having me as a trainer in your organization or at your conference? Feel free to send me an email at bas@ontestautomation.com, or use the contact form on [this page](/contact/).

Iâ€™m looking forward to help you improve your test automation efforts!
