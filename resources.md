### <a name="workshops"></a>Open source workshops

Did you know that I am sharing some of the workshops that I have created and delivered in the past in an open source format?

This means that everybody who wants to use, deliver and alter any of the material contained within any of these workshops is free to do so.

<p><a href="https://github.com/basdijkstra/rest-assured-workshop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="btn btn--primary">API testing in Java using REST Assured</a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/basdijkstra/wiremock-workshop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="btn btn--primary">API mocking in Java using WireMock</a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/basdijkstra/rest-assured-net-workshop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="btn btn--primary">API testing in C# using RestAssured.Net</a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/basdijkstra/wiremock-net-workshop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="btn btn--primary">API mocking in C# using WireMock.Net</a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/basdijkstra/restsharp-workshop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="btn btn--primary">API testing in C# using RestSharp</a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/basdijkstra/requests-workshop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="btn btn--primary">API testing in Python using requests</a></p>

Why giving away this all for everybody for free? Consider this my way of giving back to the testing and test automation community, which has given and taught me so much during my career so far. Also, I'm a firm believer in

> 'Give, and it shall be given unto you'

Happy learning!
