Test automation is an integral part of many software development and testing teams&#8217; activities nowadays. No surprise there. However, many of those teams, and even entire organizations, are still struggling with making their test automation efforts a success.

Just throwing tools at the problem will not make your software testing activities more efficient. You will need a solid test automation strategy, and to get there, you&#8217;ll need to be able to ask the right questions. You&#8217;ll also need to be able to identify what to automate and how this can be done in the most efficient way before you start writing automated tests.

And that&#8217;s exactly what this course will teach you!

**Course contents**  
This course covers, among other things:

  * Why so many test automation efforts fail
  * How to create a solid test automation strategy that will support your testing efforts
  * What questions to ask when you&#8217;re starting out on your test automation journey
  * How to identify what can and should be automated, as well as what can or should not
  * How to identify seams in your application that can help you create more efficient test automation
  * What different types of tools there are, and what their relative benefits and drawbacks are

There&#8217;s no better way to learn than by doing, so you&#8217;ll be presented with a variety of hands-on exercises and cases throughout this course.
