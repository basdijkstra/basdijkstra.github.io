In the past few years, more and more people have approached me to ask whether I delivered my [training](https://www.ontestautomation.com/training/) services online as well as in person. For those of you that did, or are otherwise interested in attending my workshops: I have some good news for you!

As of today, **I&#8217;m offering a number of my half-day workshops online** as well as in person.

[Go to online workshops page](https://www.ontestautomation.com/online-workshops/)

That means you can attend these workshops from the comfort of your own home or workplace, without the additional burden of having to travel.

I will conduct these workshops via <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Whereby (opens in a new tab)" href="https://whereby.com" target="_blank">Whereby</a>, an online platform I have used for online training in the past. [I&#8217;ve learned a lot](https://www.ontestautomation.com/on-delivering-automation-training-online/) from my past online training experiences, and therefore I&#8217;m using a strict upper limit of 5 (five) participants per workshop.

Interested? I&#8217;m inviting you to have a look at the [online workshops page](https://www.ontestautomation.com/online-workshops/) to see if there&#8217;s a workshop for you. If you can&#8217;t find what you&#8217;re looking for, [let me know](https://www.ontestautomation.com/contact/).

I am looking forward to meeting you (virtually) in one of my workshops, soon!
