The following terms and conditions apply to all online workshops provided by On Test Automation.

### Change of date

The exact dates of any online workshop may be subject to change due to the following circumstances:

  1. Illness of the teacher
  2. Too few registrations (a minimum of two participants is required)

On Test Automation will do everything in its power to make every scheduled workshop a reality. If this is not possible, we will contact each registrant as early in advance as possible to reschedule.

### Cancellation

You are allowed to cancel any workshop registration under the following conditions:

  1. Up to 4 working days before the workshop, you can cancel your registration and get a 100% refund.
  2. Up to 2 working days before the workshop, you can cancel your registration and get a 50% refund.
  3. After that, we unfortunately cannot refund your workshop registration fee.

### Payment due dates

Payment is due within 30 days of the invoice date, via wire transfer, to the bank account as mentioned on the invoice. Unfortunately, On Test Automation cannot at the moment accept other methods of payment.
