Summer holidays.. A perfect time for taking a step or two back from work and reflect on the work I&#8217;ve been doing this year. Having just returned from my vacation, this year has been no different. One theme (or rather, one question) kept coming back over and over again this time:

> How do I go from being &#8216;good&#8217; to being &#8216;great&#8217;?

I consider myself to be a decent, maybe even a good consultant / writer / teacher / whatever it is I&#8217;m doing that day. While this is enough to be pretty fully booked at the moment, and even have the option to say &#8216;no&#8217; to tasks or projects I don&#8217;t really want to take on, I feel I can do better in many ways. It doesn&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m failing, but there&#8217;s a lot of things that I feel I can improve.

Here&#8217;s a(n incomplete) list of things I&#8217;d like to accomplish on my journey from good to great:

  * Improving my consulting skills
  * Improving my public speaking skills
  * Improving my teaching skills
  * Improving my writing skills

These improvements would, in turn, hopefully lead to the following results:

  * I&#8217;d like to grow a (small) back log of clients that I keep in close touch with and that I can help with their automation on a periodic basis, moving away from the hourly billing model towards a daily fee or a retainer
  * I&#8217;d like to speak at more conferences, and not just at testing conferences
  * I&#8217;d love to get more bookings for my training and workshop offerings
  * I&#8217;d like to write and publish a short (e)book containing my views on the test automation craft

That&#8217;s only part of the story, though. What would happen if I accomplished the above tasks? Would I see myself as a great consultant, rather than &#8216;just&#8217; a good one? Being the cynical and self-criticizing b\*st\*rd that I can be, will I ever consider myself being more than half decent?

Putting that aside, there are definitely things I want to achieve this year, all of them totally unrelated to getting more knowledgeable with regards to specific test automation tools. I just don&#8217;t think that that&#8217;s going to get me much closer to what I want to be.

According to you, readers of this blog, how do you think one moves up from &#8216;good&#8217; to &#8216;great&#8217;? I&#8217;d love to see your input on this matter! In the meantime, I will start to reach out to people that I consider to be on the &#8216;great&#8217; level, see how they got to where they are now and what I can learn from them. Call it looking for a mentor (or two). In time, hopefully I can be a mentor myself. I&#8217;d love to be able to do that and teach others what I know.

If there&#8217;s one thing that my time off work has taught me this year, though, it&#8217;s that there&#8217;s so, so many things that I don&#8217;t know or don&#8217;t master!
