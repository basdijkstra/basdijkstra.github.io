APIs play a vital role in many modern software development efforts as the glue that connects different components, as well as entire systems. As a software tester or developer, it is therefore vital that you know

  * _why_ testing APIs and testing at the API level is important,
  * _what_ to look for when you’re testing APIs, and 
  * _how_ to go about testing APIs efficiently.

In this three-day API testing masterclass, you will learn all about APIs, how to test them and how to use a variety of tools to your advantage when doing so.

**Course contents**  
In this course, you’ll learn about:

  * APIs and their role in modern software
  * What to look for when testing APIs
  * Exploring APIs for testing purposes
  * Using tools for API test automation
  * API performance and security testing
  * API specifications and contract testing
  * Mocking APIs for testing purposes

as well as many other things related to testing APIs.

This masterclass is packed with a variety of exercises. Some of these will be individual, some are done in groups of 2-4 people. A number of them will be carried out on laptops, but there will be other exercise formats too. Interaction is a key component in this course.

**Intended audience and prerequisite knowledge**  
This course is aimed at software testers and developers that want to learn more about testing APIs and using tools to do so more efficiently.

Some prior exposure to (object-oriented) software development and test automation can be helpful. I am confident, however, that even without this you will find this masterclass to be very useful.

**After this course**  
After completing this API testing masterclass, you’ll know why knowing how to test APIs is so important, what to look for when you’re testing APIs and how to use tools to your advantage in your API testing efforts. You’ll leave this course with a collection of tools, examples and resources for further studying that will help you in your day to day work.

**Delivery and group size**  
I currently offer this course in person, on site only. The maximum group size is 12.

**Duration**  
This masterclass spans three working days.
