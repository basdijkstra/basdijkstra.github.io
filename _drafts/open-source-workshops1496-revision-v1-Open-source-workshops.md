Recently, I have decided to start sharing workshops that I have created and delivered in the past as open source. This means that everybody who wants to use, deliver and alter any of the material contained within any of these workshops is free to do so.

Why giving away this all for everybody for free? Consider this my way of giving back to the testing and test automation community, which has given and taught me so much during my career so far. Also, I&#8217;m a firm believer in &#8216;give, and you will receive&#8217;.

So far, I&#8217;ve shared three workshops through this open source principle, with more definitely on their way.
