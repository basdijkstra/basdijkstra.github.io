Can&#8217;t find the workshop you&#8217;re looking for? [Contact me](https://www.ontestautomation.com/contact/) with your request and I&#8217;ll see what I can do for you.

#### Logistics

All workshops will be 3,5 hours in duration, with a 15 minute break half way. A variety of hands-on exercises will ensure an engaging and interactive learning experience.

Instructions to prepare your machine for the workshop will be sent in advance to ensure no valuable time is lost during the workshop.

Because conducting training online is different from training in-person, these workshops will be strictly limited to **5 (five)** participants per session. This ensures that every participant receives the attention they deserve.

#### Price and registration

Until April 30, 2020, all workshops are priced at **â‚¬ 149,-** per person, excluding VAT.

This price includes:

  * Attendance to the workshop itself on the mentioned day and time 
  * Slide deck with all material that has been covered in the workshop
  * GitHub repository with all examples, exercises and answers that have been covered in the workshop
