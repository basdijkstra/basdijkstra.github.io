Only a relatively short blog post this week, but it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s kept me busy for a while..

As we&#8217;re slowly moving towards 2017, and as I&#8217;m starting to reflect on the shift I&#8217;ve been making in how I fill my days and make a living for the last year, I think this is a good time to take a look at the conferences I would like to attend and contribute to in 2017. Delivering talks, or even better, workshops (I&#8217;ll get to that at the end of this post), has earned its place as one of the activities that nowadays are part of my work(day/week) on a fairly regular basis. So, what conferences to attend next year?

**The &#8216;definitely&#8217; category**  
There are a couple of conferences I&#8217;ll definitely attend or contribute to, either because they&#8217;ve proven their value or simply because I&#8217;m already listed to deliver a talk or workshop there:

  * <a href="https://automationguild.com/" target="_blank">AutomationGuild</a> (January) &#8211; I&#8217;ll deliver a talk on testing RESTful APIs using REST Assured at the first edition of this online conference completely dedicated to test automation.
  * <a href="http://www.romaniatesting.ro/" target="_blank">Romania Testing Conference</a> (May) &#8211; I was supposed to deliver a full-day workshop on REST Assured at the first edition of a spin-off conference of RTC, but unfortunately the organization had to postpone the event. They were extremely kind, however, to extend their invitation to the 2017 edition of the original event, which is held in Cluj in May, so I&#8217;m Romania bound by then! Very much looking forward to that, as you can imagine, especially after the wonderful experience of <a href="http://www.ontestautomation.com/review-testcon-2016-speaking-abroad-for-the-first-time/" target="_blank">my first talk abroad</a>.
  * <a href="http://www.testworksconf.com/" target="_blank">TestWorksConf</a> (October) &#8211; The <a href="http://www.ontestautomation.com/review-testworks-conf-2015/" target="_blank">first</a> <a href="http://www.ontestautomation.com/review-testworksconf-2016/" target="_blank">two</a> editions have been awesome and I&#8217;m already eager to see what the Xebia guys can come up with for the third edition. Maybe I&#8217;ll be a conributor again, but if not, I&#8217;ll definitely be there as a delegate.
  * <a href="http://www.testautomationday.com/" target="_blank">Test Automation Day</a> (June) &#8211; The other big conference in the Netherlands dedicated to test automation, this has been a &#8216;must&#8217; for me for the last four or five years, and I&#8217;ll highly likely be there again next year. Hopefully as a speaker this time, something that&#8217;s still on my to-do list.

**The &#8216;hopefully&#8217; category**  
There is one European conferences outside of The Netherlands that I&#8217;d like to attend or contribute to one day. And why shouldn&#8217;t that day be in 2017?

  * <a href="http://swtestingforum.org/en/" target="_blank">Software Testing Forum</a> (June) &#8211; I must admit that the location of this conference is what first put it on my radar. I love Italy, its culture, its language and not to forget its food and wine, but the event itself has started to get my attention as well over the last couple of years. I&#8217;ve recently been in touch with the organizing committee to see if I can apply to deliver a workshop there, so here&#8217;s to hoping that turns out positively!

**The &#8216;I wish&#8217; category**  
Some day, some day, I&#8217;d like to attend (or even better, speak at) one of these conferences:

  * <a href="http://starcanada.techwell.com" target="_blank">StarCanada</a> (October) &#8211; I love Canada, plus I&#8217;ve always wanted to attend one of the big Star* conferences, even if only once. Travel and lodging aren&#8217;t exactly cheap, though, plus it would cost me at least a whole week of not being home, which isn&#8217;t exactly ideal with small children, so this will probably not happen for the next couple of years.
  * <a href="http://www.wetest.co.nz/" target="_blank">WeTest</a> (twice a year) &#8211; Pretty much the same reason as the previous one: I love New Zealand. Plus from what I&#8217;ve read on the web and social media, the organization and quality of thiss conference is of a pretty high level. Unfortunately, so is the amount of hours I&#8217;d have to spend on the plane, so this will probably not happen in 2017 either..

**What else?**  
So, my dear readers, is there a conference I might have forgotten? Some hidden gem you definitely think I should attend or even apply to contribute to? I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts!

Oh, and coming back to my preference on hosting workshops over delivering talks: I love to give talks on topics I care about, but from my experience, I love hosting workshops even more. The smaller crowd and longer time frame allows me to make better contact with and pay more attention to the attendees, and to get some interesting discussions going. This to me provides more value than the larger (yet somewhat more fleeting) exposure I get when delivering a talk.. Plus I think participants get more out of a workshop too because of the hands-on learning experience, as opposed to attending a talk and picking up a couple of interesting and thought-provoking nuggets of wisdom. So if you know of an interesting conference that does workshops too, please let me know!
