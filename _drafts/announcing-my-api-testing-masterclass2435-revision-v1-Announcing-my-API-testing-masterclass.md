Do you want to learn more about APIs and how to test them? Have you been looking for a comprehensive course that teaches you everything there is to know about testing APIs and testing software systems at the API level? If so, you might want to read on!

Many API testing courses out there focus on a specific tool or technique that you can leverage to improve your API testing efforts. While those courses definitely have their use, I feel there&#8217;s much more to it if you really want to become well-versed in testing APIs and testing systems at the API level.

That&#8217;s the reason I created a brand new, three day masterclass that will teach you, among other things, about:

  * APIs and their role in modern software systems
  * Why to test APIs, and why to test at the API level
  * What to look for when testing APIs
  * Exploring APIs for testing purposes
  * Using tools for API test automation
  * API performance and security testing
  * API specifications and contract testing
  * Mocking APIs for testing purposes

A much more detailed description of this API testing masterclass, including a day-to-day breakdown of course contents and learning goals, can be found on the [course page](https://www.ontestautomation.com/training/api-testing-masterclass/).

**Need to convince your manager?**  
Please send them this [course flyer](https://www.ontestautomation.com/files/api_testing_masterclass_flyer.pdf), highlighting all of the benefits and providing a summary of the training course, all neatly on a single page. And don&#8217;t forget to bring the Early Bird discount to their attention!

I&#8217;m looking forward to many successful deliveries of this API testing masterclass, and I hope to see you all at one of them.
