New project, new environment, new tools to explore! I just started as a test engineer on a new project involving some of Holland&#8217;s most visited job sites. An environment where a lot of PHP and JavaScript is used as opposed to Java and C#. This also means I get to learn a lot of new stuff (I&#8217;ve not worked much in web development projects before) and a lot of new and interesting test automation tools and concepts to explore and apply. Which I can then use to bore you.

The first tool I get to explore is <a href="http://jasmine.github.io/" target="_blank">Jasmine</a>, a BDD-style tool for testing JavaScript code. As with most other BDD tools, it&#8217;s only truly a BDD tool if you use it as such and I&#8217;m not yet convinced that we&#8217;re doing that right in this project. However, Jasmine offers enough interesting features for a blog post, so here we go..
