Those of you that have been reading my blog posts for a while know that I like to reflect on my own career from time to time. Since it&#8217;s been a while since I wrote such a blog post, I thought it would be a good idea to share with you what I&#8217;m up to at the moment.

Basically, my working time is still divided into three subjects: consulting, teaching and writing. I&#8217;m continuously trying to find out what is the ideal ratio between each of these activities, something that&#8217;s partly under my own control, yet also depends on the amount of work that&#8217;s coming my own. Or that I am able to steer my way, of course.

Here&#8217;s a quick recap of my activities in each of these three fields.

**Consulting**  
On site consulting still makes up the major part of my working week. Not sure how the situation is in the rest of the world, but here in the Netherlands there&#8217;s plenty of work available for those who know a little about test automation and have some communication skills too, so getting projects isn&#8217;t too hard at the moment. I have to say &#8216;no&#8217; more often than I can say &#8216;yes&#8217;!

That&#8217;s a very luxurious position to be in, I definitely realize that. And yet.. It&#8217;s safe, since I am guaranteed an income for at least 25-30 hours per week (it&#8217;s all billed by the hour), but I feel it does also make me complacent at times. This might sound strange (or spoiled), but I could actually do with a little _less_ consulting work, but that would require having more work in the other two categories. Either that, or seeing a significant (but hopefully temporary) fall in my income, a prospect which I don&#8217;t particularly look forward to.

**Teaching**  
It&#8217;s been too long, but I finally had (or created, depending on how you look at things) another opportunity to deliver on site training, this time with my former employer. I spent two evenings with around 10 students, teaching them about the concepts behind API testing and automation and introducing them to a range of tools (more on that training course and the approach I experimented with <a href="https://www.ontestautomation.com/an-experiment-in-creating-better-tool-centered-automation-training/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>). This reminded me how exciting and motivating it is to deliver training, and that it definitely is something I feel I should pursue harder. Ideally, I&#8217;d do at least two or three of these courses a month, but I&#8217;m nowhere near that frequency yet.

I _have_ started working on a related project, though. It&#8217;ll be an online course around Selenium, which will hopefully see the light of day in the coming months.

Next to that, I&#8217;m actively working on finding more ways to deliver on site training, both at clients here in the Netherlands as well as at conferences. This is a slow process, but I&#8217;ve made some good connections in the past few months and I&#8217;m positive this effort will pay off soon enough.

And while we&#8217;re on the subject of conferences: I&#8217;ve got two talks coming up this month. First, I&#8217;ll be at the fall conference of the Dutch testers association <a href="https://www.testnet.org/cgi/objects.cgi?site=testnet&#038;id=10566451&#038;conpag=&#038;detail_template=objects_agenda_item" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TestNet (site in Dutch)</a>, and later this month it&#8217;s time for <a href="https://dojo.ministryoftesting.com/events/testbash-manchester-2017" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TestBash Manchester</a>. Really looking forward to speaking at and being a part of both of these events!

Finally, I was a panelist at a webinar hosted by the people at <a href="https://www.testim.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Testim</a>, where we talked about creating an automation strategy fit for CI/CD and the skills required to do so. For those of you that missed it, you can find a recording <a href="https://www.zoom.us/recording/play/FM2PExWUYs-GLNMqRgRht_OlXGZKyLQhhz-kQGdzgbIZJd1zk2attjfCIaNn9dRh" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.

**Writing**  
This one I&#8217;ve actively put on the back burner for a while. In the past few months, I&#8217;ve written quite a few articles for <a href="https://techbeacon.com/contributors/bas-dijkstra" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TechBeacon</a>, <a href="https://www.stickyminds.com/users/bas-dijkstra" rel="noopener" target="_blank">StickyMinds</a> and some other one-off blog posts, next to my weekly blog post on this site, of course. That spread me a little thin so I decided to stick with my weekly OnTestAutomation blogs for a while.

I _am_ currently working on something related to writing, though: I&#8217;m the technical editor for a book on test automation that&#8217;s to be released in the first half of next year. This is something I&#8217;ve never done before, but that&#8217;s only a good thing.

The gist of this is that I could do with a little more teaching and a little less consulting and that I&#8217;m actively working on making that happen. As ever, it&#8217;s an interesting journey.
