I am not a developer. I have a background in Computer Science, I know a thing or two about writing code, but I am definitely not a developer. This is similar to me knowing how to prepare food, but not being a cook. People that have met me in person probably remember and will possible be bored to death by me using this analogy (sorry!).

On the other hand, I also try to repeat as often as possible that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/three-things-everybody-should-know-test-automation-bas-dijkstra" target="_blank">test automation is software development</a>, and that it should be treated as such. So, you might ask, how come I am working in test automation, yet I don&#8217;t call myself a developer? And more importantly, shouldn&#8217;t test automation be left to developers, if it really IS software development? Recent blog posts I&#8217;ve read and presentations I&#8217;ve heard have made me think a lot about this.

So, to start with the second and most important question: should test automation be left to developers? My answer would be yes.

And no.

**Test automation should be left to developers, because**  
writing automated tests involves writing code. Personally, I don&#8217;t believe in codeless solutions that advertise that &#8216;anybody&#8217; can create automated tests. So, since code writing is involved, and since nobody knows writing code better than a developer, I think that writing automated tests can best be done by a developer.

I&#8217;m going to use myself as an example here. Since writing code isn&#8217;t in my DNA, I find it takes me three times as long &#8211; at the minimum &#8211; to write automated tests compared to your average developer. And with high-pressure projects, short release cycles and the trend of having less and less testers for every developer in development teams, I just couldn&#8217;t keep up.

To make matters worse, new automation tools are being released what seems like every day. Especially within the Java and JavaScript worlds, although it might be just as good (or bad?) in other ecosystems, just less visible to me personally. I don&#8217;t know. For a while, as a non-developer, I&#8217;ve tried to keep up with all of these tools, but I just couldn&#8217;t manage. So, instead of frantically trying to keep up, I&#8217;ve made a career shift. This came naturally after I realized that

**Test automation should not be left to developers, because**  
nobody knows testing better than testers. As I said, I (and possibly many people involved in test automation along with me) am not skilled enough to compete with the best on _how_ to create automated tests. However, I think I (and a lot of others) can teach a lot of people a thing or two about the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/test-automation-start-why-bas-dijkstra" target="_blank">equally, if not more important questions</a> of _why_ you should (not) do test automation, and _what_ tests should and should not be automated.

A lot of developers I have met don&#8217;t have a testing mindset (yet!) and tend to think solely along the happy path. &#8216;Let&#8217;s see if this works&#8230;&#8217;, rather than &#8216;let&#8217;s see what happens if I do this&#8230;&#8217;, so to say. When writing automated tests, just as with creating specs for the software that needs to be built, it requires a tester&#8217;s mindset to think beyond the obvious happy flow. This is why I think it isn&#8217;t wise to see test automation as a task purely for developers.

It also helps if people other than developers feel some sort of responsibility for creating automated tests. Given that most developers are busy people, they need to choose between writing tests and writing production code on a regular basis. Almost always, that decision will be made in favor of production code. This does make sense from a deadline perspective, but not always as much when you look at it from a quality and process point of view. Having people in other roles (testing, for example) stressing the need for a mature and stable automated testing suite will definitely improve the likelyhood of such a suite actually being created and maintained. Which might just benefit the people continuously fretting about those deadlines in the long end..

So, to answer the first question I posed at the beginning of this post: Why am I still working in test automation despite not being a developer? Because nowadays I mainly focus on helping people answer the _why_ and the _what_ of test automation. I do some stuff related to the _how_ question as well, especially for smaller clients that are at the beginning of their test automation journey or that don&#8217;t have a lot of experienced developers in house, but not as much as before. I love to tinker with tools every now and then, if only just to keep up and remain relevant and hireable. I&#8217;m not as much involved in the day to day work of writing automated tests anymore, though. Which is fine with me, because it plays to my strengths. And I think that&#8217;ll benefit everybody, in the long end.

I think the test automation community could use a lot more highly skilled people that are (not) developers.
