As an independent test automation consultant, I can help you take your automation efforts to the next level in the following ways:

**By implementing test automation**  
I&#8217;ve been active in the test automation field for more than 11 years now. In that time, I&#8217;ve helped numerous clients take their first &#8211; or their next &#8211; step in creating an effective automation strategy, tailored to their needs and skills. What I can do for you?

  * Define a test automation strategy that fits your software development and delivery process like a glove
  * Review your current test automation strategy, identify bottlenecks and solve them
  * Create a robust and maintainable test automation framework and teach your staff how to run, maintain and extend it

Because I work independently from testing service providers and test tool vendors, you can be sure that I&#8217;ll put your best interest first.

**By creating test automation awareness**  
Sometimes, having &#8216;an outsider&#8217; take a fresh look at your test automation efforts or reminding your team or organization about the possibilities and pitfalls of test automation can bring a new perspective and insights to your work. I can be that outsider. I&#8217;m comfortable discussing test automation at all levels in the organization, from development teams to C-level management.

**By teaching test automation skills**  
Next to being a consultant, I am an experienced teacher on various topics related to test automation. In the past, I&#8217;ve provided training in the following formats:

  * Presentation and Q&A sessions
  * Test automation awareness workshops
  * In depth, hands on automation training focusing on one or more test automation tools

Next to presentations and workshops &#8216;in house&#8217; at your organization, I&#8217;m also very much open to sharing my knowledge and experiences at conferences, so if you&#8217;re a conference organizer looking for someone to talk or teach your delegates about test automation, feel free to contact me too.

If you would like to work with me, I&#8217;m happy to explore opportunities and find the best fit for all parties involved. You can contact me by filling out the form on the [contact page](http://www.ontestautomation.com/contact/), or send me an email directly at bas@ontestautomation.com.

I&#8217;m looking forward to working with you.
