Last week I experienced another &#8216;first&#8217; in my career as a consultant: my first speaking gig abroad. The event: <a href="http://www.testcon.lt/" target="_blank">TestCon 2016</a>. Location: Vilnius, Lithuania. Another first there: I&#8217;d never been to Lithuania before! I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect, but hey, the best things in life happen when you least expect them, so I was happy to jump to the opportunity when my friends at <a href="http://www.parasoft.com" target="_blank">Parasoft</a> called me to ask me if I could act as a stand-in for one of their guys who couldn&#8217;t make it to the conference.

**The conference**  
TestCon 2016 was the first edition of this conference, but you wouldn&#8217;t be able to tell this if you hadn&#8217;t known that before. The event was very well organized, with a good venue (the University of Applied Sciences) and excellent speaker treatment. A separate room for speakers to prepare for their presentation and to wind down afterwards was a first for me, although granted, I am nowhere near an experienced public speaker yet&#8230; And don&#8217;t forget full travel and lodging expenses were covered upfront, something that a lot of conferences could learn from. Another remarkable feat is that the organization managed to attract around 600 (yes, six hundred) attendees to this first edition. For a relatively small country with no established testing community, that is absolutely amazing. I think a lot of other conference organizers would consider themselves extremely lucky to get such a turnout. The only thing that could use some improvement next year is the number of local speakers. Of the 25 speakers, only 3 or 4 were from Lithuania. In comparison, there were 6 from the Netherlands.. I talked to one of the organizers afterwards and we agreed that hopefully this first event, which was a major success, leads to more local speakers next year.

**My talk**  
The talk that was originally proposed by Parasoft was called &#8216;Deploy and Destroy Complete Test Environments: Service Virtualization, Containers and Cloud&#8217;. As this is an area that interests me as well, and in which I have experience as well as have done some writing and speaking work before, I decided to keep it and construct a story based on my own experience around it. For those of you that are interested in what I talked about, you can see the slides here:



I think my talk went pretty well, although there wasn&#8217;t too much feedback or reaction from the audience. Later I heard that more speakers experienced this (but some didn&#8217;t), so it might not just have been me, at least I hope not. It confirmed my preference for delivering workshops rather than talks though, since you let a lot more interaction and feedback from workshops due to the smaller groups and the hands-on work rather than just me broadcasting information (or sound, at least). Still, I got some questions and had a couple of good discussions afterwards, so the overall feeling I have looking back on my talk is a positive one.

**Looking back**  
As I said, this has been my first experience as a speaker abroad, but as far as I&#8217;m concerned it will not have been my last one. Travelling, speaking and meeting interesting and fun people has been a very rewarding experience, although an exhausting one as well. The conference itself couldn&#8217;t have been organized any better (except for a couple of minor details, maybe). Also, the organization and all volunteers I have had the pleasure of meeting couldn&#8217;t have been nicer and more welcoming, and Vilnius has been an interesting city to spend a couple of days in. I&#8217;m already looking forward to the next trip, even though it hasn&#8217;t been planned yet. I&#8217;ll try and make it a workshop gig as that&#8217;s where my interests and strengths are, I believe, but I won&#8217;t say no to delivering another talk, either.
