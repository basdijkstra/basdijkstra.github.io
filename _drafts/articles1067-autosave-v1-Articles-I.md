**Talks**  
So far, I&#8217;ve only found one truly publicly available recording of a talk I have done. This is me speaking at TestCon in Vilnius, Lithuania back in October 2016.

Here&#8217;s a (sort of) complete list of all articles I have written for various industry websites and magazines.

Have you read some of them? I would love to hear your thoughts!
