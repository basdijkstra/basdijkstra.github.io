With APIs playing a critical role in modern software systems and architectures, knowing how to test and automate at the API level is an essential skill for you as a tester.

In this course, you&#8217;ll learn how to create readable, maintainable and powerful tests in Java using the open source API test tool <a href="http://rest-assured.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">REST Assured</a>.

**Course contents**  
This course covers, among other things:

  * Discovering opportunities for testing at the API level
  * Deciding where (not) to apply automation at the API level
  * Writing readable and powerful tests with REST Assured
  * Parameterizing your tests for increased flexibility and coverage
  * Working with JSON- and XML-based RESTful APIs
  * Increasing maintainability by removing duplicate code and configuration
  * Leveraging Hamcrest, GPath and XmlPath
  * Creating more complex API test scenarios
  * Working with Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs) to create requests and verify responses

There&#8217;s no better way to learn than by doing, so you&#8217;ll be presented with a variety of hands-on (programming) exercises throughout this course.

**Intended audience and prerequisite knowledge**  
This course is aimed at testing practitioners that want to learn more about writing automation at the API level, why this is such a good idea and how REST Assured can help you provide for your API automation needs. Some previous exposure to object-oriented software development and test automation will make it easier for you to follow along, but participants new to these concepts will get a lot from this course as well.

**Delivery and group size**  
I currently offer this course in person, on site only. The maximum group size is 12.

**Duration**  
This course takes one working day.
