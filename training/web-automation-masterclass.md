There is a lot to learn for those of you wanting to get started or get ahead in automation web applications. However, most courses that are currently available on this subject only focus on a specific area or an individual tool.

It's a(n often underappreciated) fact that user interface-driven automation of web applications is among the hardest forms of automation out there, and to do it right, you'll need to learn more than how to wield a single tool. It is vital that you also know:

  * how to create a solid web automation strategy
  * how to recognize and avoid the pitfalls of web automation  
  * what types of tools are available for web automation and how to choose the right tool for the job 
  * how to apply good programming principles and patterns to create readable and maintainable web automation that you can trust

In this three-day web automation masterclass, you will learn all about web automation and how to make its implementation a success for your team and organization.

**Day 1 - Web automation strategy**  
The first day of the masterclass lays the groundwork for days 2 and 3. We will cover, among other things:

  * Common pitfalls in web automation and how to spot, overcome and avoid them
  * How to create a solid web automation strategy
  * Deciding what (not) to automate through the (web) user interface
  * When (not) to use cross-browser testing

After completing day 1, you will have a clear overview of the realm of web automation, what it takes to do this specific type of automation well and what are some of the common pitfalls of web automation. 

**Day 2 - Web automation tools**  
On day 2, we will take a closer look at some of the most popular tools for web automation, as well as at what they have in common and how they differ. We will take a look at:

  * Selenium WebDriver
  * Cypress
  * Playwright
  * Visual testing and validation tools
  * How to choose the right tool for the job

After completing day 2, you will have gained some experience in using several types of tools to support your web automation efforts. You will leave with various examples and suggestions that you can apply in your own context.

**Day 3 - Web automation engineering**  
In the final day of this masterclass, we will take a look at what it takes to write maintainable and readable web automation, as well as how to integrate your tests into your Continuous Integration pipeline. We will cover, among other things:

  * How to write good element locators
  * The role of Artificial Intelligence in web automation  
  * Using the Page Object pattern
  * Using the Screenplay pattern
  * Adding your (by now rock solid) web automation tests to your CI pipeline

After completing day 3, you will have a good overview of the field of web automation. You can explain the role and place of web automation in an overall testing and software development strategy, and you will have gained knowledge of and experience with a wide range of tools and patterns that can help you create web automation that actually works.

This masterclass is very hands-on and packed with exercises. Some of these will be individual, some are done in groups of 2-4 people. A number of them will be carried out on laptops, but there will be other exercise formats too. Interaction is a key component in this course.

**Intended audience and prerequisite knowledge**  
This course is aimed at software testers and developers that want to learn more about web automation and what it takes to do it well.

Some prior exposure to (object-oriented) software development and test automation will definitely be helpful. I am confident, however, that even without this you will find this masterclass to be very useful.

**After this course**  
After completing this web automation masterclass, you’ll know how to create a good web automation strategy, what tools are available and how to relate to one another, and how to use them to build solid automation for web applications. You’ll leave this course with a collection of tools, examples and resources for further studying that will help you in your day to day work.

**Delivery and group size**  
This is a live training course, available both on site and online.
