When we think about API testing, many times our thoughts immediately focus on tools and writing code to perform automated checks for APIs.

What we sometimes tend to forget, though, is that we might want to explore our APIs, too, to uncover any hidden problems and discover behaviour we did not consider or discuss during design or development.

Performing exploratory testing on APIs isn't that different from performing exploratory testing on systems through a graphical user interface.

In this workshop, you'll learn how to start performing exploratory testing on APIs using common tools and some useful guidelines to help you come up with ideas for tests.   

## What will you learn?
In this workshop you will learn, among other things:

* Why testing your APIs is important
* How the [the POISED heuristic](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/exploring-service-apis-through-test-automation/){:target="_blank"} can help you come up with API test ideas
* How to perform tests on APIs using common API clients and test tools
* How to interpret and present exploratory API testing results

There's no better way to learn than by doing, so you'll spend plenty of time performing tests on different types of APIs.

I often run this workshop using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/){:target="_blank"} or [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/){:target="_blank"}, but I'm happy to use the API testing tool of your choice, too.

## Who should take this workshop? 
This workshop is great for testers and developer who want to learn more about testing their APIs.

Some prior knowledge of APIs, HTTP and REST is beneficial, but I am confident that even without this, you will find this workshop to be very valuable.

## Workshop duration and delivery
This exploratory API testing workshop takes 3-4 hours. It works great either as an on-site or an online in-company workshop, or as a half-day conference tutorial.
