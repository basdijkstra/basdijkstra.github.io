Test automation is an integral part of many software development and testing teams' activities nowadays. No surprise there. However, many of those teams, and even entire organizations, are still struggling with making their test automation efforts a success.

Just throwing tools at the problem will not make your software testing activities more efficient. You will need a solid test automation strategy, and to get there, you'll need to be able to ask the right questions. You'll also need to be able to identify what to automate and how this can be done in the most efficient way before you start writing automated tests.

And that's exactly what this course will teach you!

**Course contents**  
This course covers, among other things:

  * Why so many test automation efforts fail

  * How to identify what can and should be automated, as well as what can or should not
  * How to identify seams in your application that can help you create more efficient test automation
