Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) is a process that aims to uncover and resolve communication problems by creating a shared understanding of the behaviour of a software product before it is developed.

That all sounds well and good, but how do you do that? This workshop will teach you how to get started with BDD and the tools and techniques that support it, as well as some of the most common pitfalls and challenges by teams trying to implement BDD.

## What will you learn?
In this workshop you will learn, among other things:

  * What the three steps of the 'textbook' BDD process are
  * How to use Specification by Example and Example Mapping to facilitate and structure conversations around desired behaviour of a piece of work (Discovery)
  * How to use the Gherkin syntax to document expected behaviour and create living documentation (Formulation)
  * How to use tools like [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/){:target="_blank"} or [Reqnroll](https://reqnroll.net/){:target="_blank"} to drive acceptance tests from your specifications (Automation)
  * What common misunderstandings and pitfalls when practicing BDD often occur
  * What it takes to implement BDD in your organization

The Automation part of this workshop can be run in the programming language of your choice.

## Who should take this workshop?
This workshop is great for testers, developers, business analysts, product owners and any other folks who want to learn more about what BDD can do for their development process.

No prior experience with BDD is required, but if you have specific questions or examples from your context, I am happy to reference and use them in the workshop.

## Workshop duration and delivery
This BDD workshop takes 6-8 hours. It works great either as an on-site or an online in-company workshop, or as a full-day conference tutorial.
