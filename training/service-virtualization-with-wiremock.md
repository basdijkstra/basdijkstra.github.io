title: Service virtualization with WireMock
layout: page
---
Modern software systems are built from several, often many, different components and subsystems that are individually created, often in different development teams or even different organizations. This makes integration and end-to-end testing much more complex, since you'll need to ensure somehow that test environments are available for all of the components involved, and that all test environments contain the right test data required for testing. Add the continuously increasing velocity of development and test cycles in the mix, and you can see how efficient test environment management can quickly become a daunting, if not impossible task.

One possible solution to this problem is the smart application of service virtualization, a technique that involves creating simulations (also known as mocks, stubs or virtual assets) that mimic the behaviour of those critical yet hard-to-access dependencies for testing purposes.

In this workshop, you'll learn to work with WireMock, a popular open source service virtualization solution for the Java ecosystem.

**Workshop contents**  
This workshop covers, among other things:

  * Problems in modern, distributed testing environments
  * How service virtualization can be leveraged to solve these problems
  * How WireMock fits into your software development and testing process
  * Creating mocks by using WireMock as a proxy
  * Creating mocks in Java code
  * Creating mocks using JSON mapping files
  * Request matching
  * Response templating
  * Fault simulation
  * Creating stateful mocks

There's no better way to learn than by doing, so you'll be presented with a variety of hands-on (programming) exercises throughout this workshop.

**Intended audience and prerequisite knowledge**  
This workshop is aimed at development and testing practitioners that want to learn more about service virtualization, and how to improve your development and testing efforts using WireMock. Participants are expected to have some prior experience in Java software or automation development.

**Delivery and group size**  
This workshop is a great fit both for an in house training session as well as a half or full day conference tutorial. I recommend a maximum group size of around 15-20 people.

**Duration**  
This workshop typically takes 3-4 hours, but can be extended to a full-day tutorial.
