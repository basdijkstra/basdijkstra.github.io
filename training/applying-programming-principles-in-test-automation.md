> "Test automation is software development"

We've all heard this before, but still, many people who want to grow as a test automation engineer struggle because of this: a lack of fundamental object-oriented programming skills. 

That's where this workshop comes in.

In this workshop, you'll learn how to increase your value as a test automation engineer by improving your object-oriented programming skills.

You can use these skills to start working on or get better at writing automation code, but they will also be a massive help in improving your conversations and collaboration efforts with the developers in your team.  

#### Workshop contents  
This course covers, among other things:

  * A (renewed) introduction to objects, classes, constructors, methods and parameters
  * Fundamental principles of OOP: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and abstraction
  * The SOLID principles: Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation and Dependency Inversion
  * When and how to apply these principles to your test code
  * When and how to apply these principles to your application code to improve testability

There's no better way to learn than by doing, so you'll be presented with lots of code reviewing and hands-on programming exercises throughout this workshop.

I can deliver this workshop in Java, C# as well as in Python.

#### Intended audience and prerequisite knowledge  
This course is aimed at both testing practitioners and developers who want to learn to write better code to help them in their testing, automation and development efforts.

#### Delivery and group size  
This is a live workshop, available both on site and online. The maximum group size is 12.

#### Duration  
This is a 1-day workshop, but it can be shortened or extended depending on specific topics you want to include.

This workshop also goes really well together with a second day going through _your_ code base and apply what we have learned in the workshop together.
