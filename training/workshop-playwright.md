The number of teams and organizations adopting [Playwright](https://playwright.dev){:target="_blank"} for their automation efforts is quickly growing, and Playwright is outgrowing its status of being 'the new kid on the block' in test automation and quickly becoming the tool of choice for many.

But what makes Playwright different from other tools? What _can_ you (not) do with Playwright? And how do you get started?

I have created this hands-on workshop to address exactly those questions, and set you on your way to test automation success with Playwright. 

#### Workshop outline
This workshop covers the following topics:

* An introduction to Playwright and how it differs from other popular, open source automation libraries
* Creating a new Playwright project
* Writing and running your first Playwright test
* How to find and interact with elements on a web page
* Using Page Objects to create tests that are easier to read and maintain
* Storing and reusing browser state (for example to avoid having to log in every time)
* Using Playwright to invoke and write tests for APIs
* Debugging your tests
* Tracing your test execution
* Making your tests part of a Continuous Integration pipeline

#### Intended audience and prerequisite knowledge  
This course is aimed at software testers and developers that want to learn more about Playwright and how to use it for their automation efforts.

Some prior knowledge of both web and API automation, as well as being comfortable writing and running object-oriented code is beneficial. I am confident, however, that even without this you will find this workshop to be very useful.

#### Delivery and group size
This workshop is a great fit both for an on site or an online in house training session, as well as a half or full day conference tutorial. I recommend a maximum group size of around 15-20 people.

I can deliver this workshop in all languages supported by Playwright: C#, Java, Python and JavaScript. 

#### Duration
This workshop is a full-day tutorial, but can be brought back to 3-4 hours on request.
