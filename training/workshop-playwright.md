The number of teams and organizations adopting [Playwright](https://playwright.dev){:target="_blank"} for their automation efforts is quickly growing, and Playwright is outgrowing its status of being 'the new kid on the block' in test automation and quickly becoming the tool of choice for many.

But what makes Playwright different from other tools? What _can_ you (not) do with Playwright? And how do you get started?

This hands-on introductory workshop addresses exactly those questions. It is designed to set you on your way to test automation success with Playwright.

## What will you learn?
In this workshop you will learn, among other things:

* What Playwright is, and how it differs from other popular, open source automation libraries
* How to write and run your first Playwright test
* How to save and use traces of your tests
* How to identify and interact with objects on a web page
* How Playwright handles auto-waiting and synchronization
* How to write and use Page Objects to create tests that are easier to read and maintain
* How to use Playwright to both perform and mock API calls

There's no better way to learn than by doing, so you'll be presented with a variety of hands-on (programming) exercises throughout this workshop.

I can run this workshop using the Playwright bindings in TypeScript, Java, C# or Python.

## Who should take this workshop?  
This workshop is great for testers and developers who want to learn the basics of Playwright, and how to use this versatile framework in their test automation efforts.

Some prior knowledge of the object-oriented programming is beneficial, but I am confident that even without this, you will find this workshop to be very valuable.

## Workshop duration and delivery
This introduction to Playwright workshop takes 6-8 hours. It works great either as an on-site or an online in-company workshop, or as a full-day conference tutorial.
