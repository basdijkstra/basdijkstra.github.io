There are many, many tools out there that help you write and run tests for your APIs, both low code and code-based.

While writing tests in code might seem daunting to some, there are code libraries out there that make writing tests for your APIs in code very straightforward. Having your tests written in code has many advantages:

* Bringing your tests under version control to enable collaboration is straightforward
* Running your tests as part of a build pipeline is straightforward
* With tests in code lowers the barrier for collaboration between testers and developers

But how do you get started writing tests for your APIs in code? What features do API testing libraries have to offer when you're writing your tests?  

In this workshop, you'll learn how to get started writing tests for HTTP-based APIs using any of the following libraries:

* [RestAssured](https://rest-assured.io/){:target="_blank"} (Java)
* [RestAssured.Net](https://github.com/basdijkstra/rest-assured-net){:target="_blank"} (C#)
* [RestSharp](https://restsharp.dev/){:target="_blank"} (C#)
* [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/){:target="_blank"} (Python)

#### Workshop outline
This workshop covers the following topics:

* Choosing between code-based and low code tools for your API test automation efforts
* Adding an API testing library to your test suite
* Writing your first API tests
* Verifying API response status codes, headers and body elements
* Working with JSON and XML requests and responses
* Working with API authentication mechanisms
* Extracting and reusing values from API responses to create scenarios
* (De-)serializing objects from / to JSON and XML 
* Working with GraphQL APIs
* Making your tests part of a build pipeline

Because there is no better way to learn than by doing, you'll work on many different hands-on exercises throughout the workshop.

#### Intended audience and prerequisite knowledge  
This course is aimed at software testers and developers that want to learn more about writing tests for their APIs in code.

#### Delivery and group size
This workshop is a great fit both for an on site or an online in house training session, as well as a half or full day conference tutorial. I recommend a maximum group size of around 15-20 people.

#### Duration
This workshop typically takes 3-4 hours, but can be extended to a full-day tutorial.
