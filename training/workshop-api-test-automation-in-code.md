There are many, many tools out there that help you write and run tests for your APIs, both low code and code-based. While writing tests in code might seem daunting to some, there are code libraries out there that greatly simplify writing tests for your APIs in code. 

Writing your API tests in code has several advantages:

* Easier and better version control for your tests
* Straightforward build pipeline integration
* Increased collaboration between testers and developers

But how do you get started writing tests for your APIs in code? What features do API testing libraries have to offer when you're writing your tests?  

In this workshop, you'll learn how to get started writing tests for HTTP-based APIs using one of the following libraries:

* [RestAssured](https://rest-assured.io/){:target="_blank"} (Java)
* [RestAssured.Net](https://github.com/basdijkstra/rest-assured-net){:target="_blank"} (C#)
* [RestSharp](https://restsharp.dev/){:target="_blank"} (C#)
* [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/){:target="_blank"} (Python)

## What will you learn?
In this workshop you will learn, among other things:

* How to write and run your first API tests in code
* How to verify response properties, such as HTTP status codes, headers and response body elements
* How to work with API authentication mechanisms
* How to extract and reuse values from API responses to create API test scenarios
* How to (de-)serializing objects from / to JSON and XML for flexible payload creation and verification 

Because there is no better way to learn than by doing, you'll work on many different hands-on exercises throughout the workshop.

## Who should take this workshop?  
This workshop is great for testers and developers who want to learn more about writing tests for their APIs in code.

Some prior knowledge of APIs, HTTP and JSON and XML is beneficial, but I am confident that even without this, you will find this workshop to be very valuable.

## Workshop duration and delivery
This API test automation in code workshop takes 3-4 hours. It works great either as an on-site or an online in-company workshop, or as a half-day conference tutorial.
