In a world where new software applications are increasingly often built upon a microservices-based architecture, where multiple teams are building, deploying and running services and components independently, it can be hard to verify whether all these individual services can still communicate with one another over time.

One of the techniques that can help you, your team and organization to deploy your services with confidence without the fear of not being able to communicate with those that rely on you is Consumer Driven Contract Testing (CDCT). In this workshop, you&#8217;ll learn what CDCT is and does, where it fits into your overall testing strategy and how the Pact framework can help you execute CDCT.

**Workshop contents**  
This workshop covers, among other things:

  * Testing challenges emerging from microservices-based architectures
  * What problem CDCT solves
  * How CDCT relates to other API testing techniques
  * An overview of CDCT tools and how they work
  * How to create a contract with the Pact CDCT tool
  * How to maintain and extend your contracts using Pact features
  * How to use the Pact broker to distribute contracts and verification results

There&#8217;s no better way to learn than by doing, so you&#8217;ll be presented with a variety of hands-on (programming) exercises throughout this course.

**Intended audience and prerequisite knowledge**  
This workshop is aimed at software development and testing practitioners that want to learn more about CDCT and how to create and execute contract tests with Pact. Some previous exposure to object-oriented software development and (API-level) test automation will make it easier for you to follow along.

**Delivery and group size**  
This workshop is a great fit both for an in house training session as well as a half or full day conference tutorial. I recommend a maximum group size of around 15-20 people.

**Duration**  
This workshop typically takes 3-4 hours, but can be extended to a full-day tutorial.
