title: Automating your API tests
layout: page
---
With APIs playing a critical role in modern software systems and architectures, knowing how to test and automate at the API level is an essential skill for you as a tester.

In this workshop, you'll learn how to create readable, maintainable and powerful tests, using an open source API test tool such as <a href="http://rest-assured.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">REST Assured</a> (Java), <a href="http://restsharp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RestSharp</a> (C#) or <a href="https://pypi.org/project/requests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">requests</a> (Python).

**Workshop contents**  
This workshop covers, among other things:

  * Discovering opportunities for testing at the API level
  * Deciding where (not) to apply automation at the API level
  * Writing readable and powerful tests API tests
  * Parameterizing your tests for increased flexibility and coverage
  * Working with JSON- and XML-based RESTful APIs
  * Increasing maintainability by removing duplicate code and configuration
  * Creating more complex API test scenarios
  * (De-)serializing objects to create requests and verify responses

There's no better way to learn than by doing, so you'll be presented with a variety of hands-on (programming) exercises throughout this workshop.

**Intended audience and prerequisite knowledge**  
This workshop is aimed at testing practitioners that want to learn more about writing automation at the API level, why this is such a good idea and how open source API testing libraries can help you provide for your API automation needs.

Some previous exposure to object-oriented software development and test automation will make it easier for you to follow along, but participants new to these concepts will get a lot from this workshop as well.

**Delivery and group size**  
This workshop is a great fit both for an in house training session as well as a half or full day conference tutorial. I recommend a maximum group size of around 15 people.

**Duration**  
This workshop typically takes 3-4 hours, but can be extended to a full-day tutorial.
