Test automation should give us valuable product feedback, fast. But did you know that your automated tests can deceive you? Do you know what the quality of your automated tests really is, and if you can trust the information produced by your tests?

Or, as the Roman Poet Juvenal put it much more eloquently:

> _Who guards the guards themselves?_

One of the techniques that can help you, your team and organization get more insight into the quality of your automated tests is **mutation testing**.

In this workshop, you'll learn how mutation testing works, what it can do for you, and how to interpret the information given to you by a mutation testing tool and use that to improve the quality of your tests.

## What will you learn?

In this workshop you will learn, among other things:

* Why code coverage alone is not a good indicator of the quality of your tests
* What mutation testing is and how mutation testing tools work
* How to interpret mutation testing results 
* How to improve your tests based on these mutation testing results
* How to get started with mutation testing in your own project

There's no better way to learn than by doing, so you'll be presented with a variety of hands-on (programming) exercises throughout this workshop.

To illustrate that mutation testing is not just for unit tests, the workshop uses an API as the system under test. This API comes complete with controller, service and repository layers, as well as a real (in-memory) database, and integration / acceptance tests to test the API.

I can run this workshop either in C#, using [Stryker.NET](https://stryker-mutator.io/docs/stryker-net/introduction/){:target="_blank"} as the mutation testing tool, or in Java, using [PIT](https://pitest.org/){:target="_blank"}.

## Who should take this workshop?
This workshop is great for developers and testers who want to learn more about mutation testing and how to use it to get more insight into and improve the quality of their tests.

Some previous exposure to object-oriented software development and test automation will make it easier for you to follow along.

## Workshop duration and delivery
This mutation testing workshop takes 3-4 hours. It works great either as an on-site or an online in-company workshop, or as a half-day conference tutorial.
