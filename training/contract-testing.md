In a world where new software applications are increasingly often built upon a microservices-based architecture, where multiple teams are building, deploying and running services and components independently, it can be hard to verify whether all these individual services can still communicate with one another over time.

Contract testing is a technique, supported by tools, that can help you deploy your services with confidence in a highly distributed software system.

In this workshop, you'll learn what contract testing is, where it fits into your overall testing strategy and how the Pact framework can help you set up and run contract tests.

**Workshop contents**  
This workshop covers, among other things:

  * Testing challenges emerging from microservices-based architectures
  * What problem contract testing solves
  * The different approaches to contract testing (consumer-driven, provider-driven and bidirectional)
  * How to create and verifying contracts
  * How to use the Pact broker to distribute contracts and verification results

There's no better way to learn than by doing, so you'll be presented with a variety of hands-on (programming) exercises throughout this course.

**Intended audience and prerequisite knowledge**  
This workshop is aimed at software development and testing practitioners that want to learn more about contract testing and how to create and execute contract tests with Pact. Some previous exposure to object-oriented software development and (API-level) test automation will make it easier for you to follow along.

**Delivery and group size**  
This workshop is a great fit both for an on site or an online in house training session, as well as a half or full day conference tutorial. I recommend a maximum group size of around 15-20 people.

**Duration**  
This workshop typically takes 3-4 hours, but can be extended to a full-day tutorial.
