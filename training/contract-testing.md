When a software is made up out of services and components that are built, deployed and run independently, it can be hard to get an answer to the question of:

> Are all individual components and services able to communicate with one another?

Contract testing is a technique, supported by tools, that can help you find an answer to this question and deploy your services with confidence.

In this workshop, you'll learn what contract testing is, where it fits into your overall testing strategy and how [the Pact framework](https://docs.pact.io){:target="_blank"} can be used to set up and run contract tests.

## What will you learn?
In this workshop you will learn, among other things:

* What problem contract testing actually solves
* The three approaches to contract testing and their respective differences
  * Consumer-driven
  * Provider-driven
  * Bidirectional
* How to use the Pact library to write contracts as a consumer and verify contracts as a provider
* How to use a Pact Broker versioning and distributing contracts and contract verification results
* How to use Pact CLI tools like `can-i-deploy` and `record-deployment` to safely automate the build and deployment process
* How to implement bidirectional contract testing with and without using the Pact library

There's no better way to learn than by doing, so you'll be presented with a variety of hands-on (programming) exercises throughout this course.

This course can be delivered using the Pact bindings in Java, C#, Python and JavaScript.

## Who should take this workshop?
This workshop is great for software developers and testers who want to learn more about contract testing and how to create and execute contract tests with Pact.

Some previous exposure to object-oriented software development and (API-level) test automation will make it easier for you to follow along.

## Workshop delivery  
This contract testing workshop takes 6-8 hours. It works great either as an on-site or an online in-company workshop, or as a full-day conference tutorial.
