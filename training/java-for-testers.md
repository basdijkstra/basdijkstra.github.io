Are you a tester working in a Java environment? Do you want to learn how to work with and contribute to automated tests written in Java? Then the &#8216;Java for testers&#8217; course is just for you!

In this course, you&#8217;ll learn to work with exactly those aspects of the Java language that are most useful to testers, as well as some of the most used Java testing tools and libraries out there.

**Course contents**  
This course covers, among other things:

  * Objects, classes, constructors, methods and parameters
  * Principles of object-oriented programming: inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism and abstraction
  * The IntelliJ IDE
  * Java projects
  * Managing dependencies with Maven
  * The JUnit test framework
  * Assertions
  * Refactoring and clean coding practices
  * API testing in Java with REST Assured
  * End-to-end testing in Java with Selenium WebDriver

There&#8217;s no better way to learn than by doing, so you&#8217;ll be presented with a variety of hands-on (programming) exercises throughout this course.

**Intended audience and prerequisite knowledge**  
This course is aimed at testing practitioners that want to learn more about writing automation code in Java, and what tools are available in the Java ecosystem to support you in that task. Some previous exposure to object-oriented software development and test automation will make it easier for you to follow along.

**Delivery and group size**  
I currently offer this course in person, on site only. The maximum group size is 12.

**Duration**  
This course takes three working days.
