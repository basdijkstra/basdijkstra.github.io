We all know it by now: test automation is software development. Unfortunately, not every test automation engineer is sufficiently well-versed in common object-oriented programming principles to apply them and write test code that is easy to read and easy to maintain. It's time to change that.

Understanding and applying fundamental object-oriented programming principles, when done in a meaningful way, can greatly boost the quality of your test automation code. In this workshop, you'll learn how to apply good programming practices to improve your automated tests and make them built to last.

##### Workshop contents  
In this hands-on workshop, we'll have a look at a number of tests we all could (and probably will) have written and, after a thorough review, improve them by applying fundamental object-oriented programming principles.

As we go along, we'll see our test code grow in readability and maintainability, while learning to recognize, apply and explain to others concepts like (de-)serialization, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction and (some of) the SOLID principles.

We'll also discuss when and were not to apply these concepts, because like so many things in life, it's all about finding the right balance!

The test code we'll work on will be written in Java or C#, but I will show and make available plenty of examples in other languages, as well as in the low-code Robot Framework tool, to demonstrate the ubiquity and versatility of the concepts discussed.

#### Intended audience and prerequisite knowledge  
This workshop is aimed at software development and testing practitioners that want to improve the quality, readability and maintainability of their automation code. Some previous exposure to object-oriented software development and test automation will make it easier for you to follow along.

#### Delivery and group size  
This workshop is a great fit both for an on site or an online in house training session, as well as a full day conference tutorial. I recommend a maximum group size of around 15-20 people.

#### Duration  
This workshop is designed to be delivered as a full-day tutorial.
