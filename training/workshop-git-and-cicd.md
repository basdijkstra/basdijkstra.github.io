The automated tests we write will only bring value when we run them early and often. To automate the process of running our tests, we typically make them part of a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.

But how does this work? And what does Git have to do with it?

In this workshop, you'll learn everything you need to get the test code you write on your machine to run as part of a CI build pipeline, as well as how to collaborate with others on your or their code using Git, the world's most popular version control system.

## What will you learn?
In this workshop you will learn, among other things:

  * An introduction to version control with Git
  * How to get your code on other people's machines, and how to get their code on yours
  * Different ways of working together (branching strategies)
  * Building a CI pipeline using GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps
  * Running tests as part of a CI pipeline
  * Adding reports to our CI pipeline

There's no better way to learn than by doing, so you'll be presented with a variety of hands-on exercises throughout this course.

By the end of the course, you will have built your own CI pipeline in GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps, and your tests will run as part of this pipeline.

It's also good to keep in mind that while we run our exercises using either GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps, everything you learn about building pipelines applies to other CI orchestrator platforms as well.

## Who should take this workshop?
This workshop is for developers and testers who want to learn more about Git, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps pipelines and implementing CI/CD using these tools.

## Workshop duration and delivery
This workshop takes 6-8 hours. It is a great fit both for an on site or an online in house training session, or as a full day conference tutorial.
