## Training course testimonials (most recent first)

_"Our company believes in the power of continuous learning, and this training delivered just that. Thoughtfully structured and rich in content, each module is built on the next, providing deep insights into essential areas like security and performance testing. Tools like REST Assured and key automation practices were valuable for our team. The instructor enhanced the learning experience by adjusting to our group's pace, encouraging open discussions, and thoughtfully addressing our questions. This was more than a training; it was an energizing knowledge exchange. It's a definite 10/10 for relevance and engagement."_

_"We gained a lot from this training, especially in automation. The hands-on exposure to tools and frameworks offered immediate value that we could take back to our projects. The fast-paced three-day format packed a lot of information, highlighting the need to separate manual and automation testing into standalone sessions for deeper focus. We're grateful to the team and the instructor for creating such a motivating and collaborative environment. It reinforced our commitment to supporting our testers and growing our collective expertise."_

_"I really enjoyed the Test Automation workshop held by Bas. It was not only engaging and well-structured, but also incredibly helpful in refreshing many key testing concepts I had forgotten over time.  What I appreciated the most was how clearly Bas explained complex ideas in a simple and relatable way. The workshop helped me gain a much better understanding of API testing and introduced me to contract testingâ€”an area I didn't have much visibility into before.  Overall, the session was insightful, practical, and full of valuable takeaways. It definitely boosted my confidence and gave me a clearer picture of how these practices fit into a real-world automation strategy."_

_"This workshop provided powerful information for us as QA engineers, a lot of content about API testing. Mostly I enjoyed the live examples and demos provided, Bas is truly an expert, he challenged our examples gracefully and answer our questions professionally."_

_"I really enjoyed the workshop and found the content engaging. While many of the concepts were familiar to me, Bas offered fresh perspectives and explained everything in a way that was both clear and enjoyable to follow. The workshop was well-balanced and interactive, without ever feeling forced or pressured to interact. I appreciated both days and only have positive things to say about the overall experience. Thank you very much for this workshop!"_

_"I really enjoyed this course. I thought it was extremely valuable to have Bas there to answer questions and expand on his slides. One of the harder parts of learning material like this online through a YouTube video for instance, is that you don't have anyone to bounce ideas off of really. This course not only let us bounce ideas off each other, but we could then confirm those with Bas. I hope we do more of these in the future."_

_"Bas pretty much set the pace based on those in attendance. It was a conversation between all of us more than him lecturing and us listening. If we had questions during his presentation of material or during our hands on time, he was more than happy to assist. I felt he wanted to be sure we understood the content before moving on to something else. I also appreciated that he wanted to work around how we tested, what tools we use and our general level of experience as we progressed through the workshop."_

_"All in all, this was a fantastic workshop. Though I am still very much a novice when it comes to API testing, I feel as though the past few weeks have set me on a much better course of learning and practicing this type of testing. It is definitely something I want to become more proficient in, and I really have to make it a point to spend time studying and practicing MUCH more often."_
