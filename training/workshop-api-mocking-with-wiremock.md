In distributed software systems, integration testing is often blocked by dependencies developed outside your team.

While there's no substitute for testing against 'the real thing', mocking systems at the API level can help you:

* Test earlier
* Test more
* Test more often

But how do you write mocks efficiently? What are useful features when you're mocking the behaviour of your dependencies? 

In this workshop, you'll learn how to start mocking the behaviour of your dependencies at the API level using [WireMock](https://wiremock.org/){:target="_blank"}, one of the most popular open source API mocking libraries available.     

#### Workshop outline
This workshop covers the following topics:

* The why and what of API mocking - when (not) to mock?
* Setting up WireMock as part of your test suite
* Writing and testing your first mocks
* Using different request matching strategies
* Fault simulation and modeling performance behaviour
* Using response templating to reuse dynamic request values in your response
* Modeling stateful behaviour in your mocks 
* Extending the behaviour of WireMock (Java only)

I can deliver this workshop using WireMock in [Java](https://wiremock.org/){:target="_blank"} and [C#](https://github.com/WireMock-Net/WireMock.Net){:target="_blank"}.

#### Intended audience and prerequisite knowledge  
This course is aimed at software testers and developers that want to learn more about API mocking and how it can help them test earlier, more and more often.

#### Delivery and group size
This workshop is a great fit both for an on site or an online in house training session, as well as a half or full day conference tutorial. I recommend a maximum group size of around 15-20 people.

#### Duration
This workshop typically takes 3-4 hours, but can be extended to a full-day tutorial.
