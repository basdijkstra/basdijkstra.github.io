In distributed software systems, integration testing is often blocked by dependencies developed outside your team.

While there's no substitute for testing against 'the real thing', mocking systems at the API level can help you test earlier, more and more often.

In this workshop, you'll learn how to start mocking the behaviour of your dependencies at the API level using [WireMock](https://wiremock.org/){:target="_blank"}, one of the most popular open source API mocking libraries available.

## What will you learn?
In this workshop you will learn, among other things:

* When (not) to mock your dependencies
* How to write and test your first mocks using WireMock
* How to use different request matching strategies and fault simulation options
* How to use response templating to reuse dynamic request values in your response
* How to model stateful behaviour in your mocks 
* How to extend the behaviour of WireMock (Java only)

I can run this workshop either in Java, using the original [WireMock](https://wiremock.org/docs/){:target="_blank"}, or in C#, using [WireMock.Net](https://wiremock.org/dotnet/){:target="blank"}.

## Who should take this workshop?
This workshop is great for testers and developers who want to learn more about finding potential security vulnerabilities in their APIs.

Some prior knowledge of APIs, HTTP and JSON and XML is beneficial, but I am confident that even without this, you will find this workshop to be very valuable.

## Workshop duration and delivery
This API security testing workshop takes 3-4 hours, but extending it to a full day is an option. It works great either as an on-site or an online in-company workshop, or as a half- or full-day conference tutorial.
