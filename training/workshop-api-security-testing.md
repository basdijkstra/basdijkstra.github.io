As of 2023, 83% of all internet traffic originates from API calls? As a result, APIs have become a very important attack vector for people with malicious intent. So, you probably want to make sure that your APIs are secure! 

But how do you get started investigating the security of your APIs? Isn't security testing something that requires deep technical knowledge and highly specific expertise?

Well, that doesn't have to be the case. In fact, you can do a lot with just a healthy dose of curiosity, creative thinking and common sense, with some guidelines to help you on your way.

In this workshop, you'll learn about some of the most common API security vulnerabilities and how to investigate whether your APIs are falling victim to them.  

## What will you learn?
In this workshop you will learn, among other things:

* How to explain the importance of testing the security of your APIs
* How to get started with API security testing using common API testing tools
* How to look for common API security vulnerabilities from the [OWASP API security top 10](https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0x11-t10/){:target="_blank"}
* Where to start looking if you want to go deeper

There's no better way to learn than by doing, so you'll spend plenty of time performing security tests on different types of APIs.

I often run this workshop using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/){:target="_blank"} or [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/){:target="_blank"}, but I'm happy to use the API testing tool of your choice, too.

## Who should take this workshop?
This workshop is great for testers and developers who want to learn more about finding potential security vulnerabilities in their APIs.

Some prior knowledge of APIs, HTTP and JSON and XML is beneficial, but I am confident that even without this, you will find this workshop to be very valuable.

## Workshop duration and delivery
This API security testing workshop takes 3-4 hours, but extending it to a full day is an option. It works great either as an on-site or an online in-company workshop, or as a half- or full-day conference tutorial.
