Your privacy is important to me. When you interact with this website - including signing up for resources, filling out forms, or simply browsing - personal information such as your name, email address, or browsing behavior may be collected. This helps me deliver the content you requested, respond to inquiries, and occasionally send updates or offers related to my services.

You may provide personal information when you:

- Fill out a contact form
- Subscribe to a newsletter or resource
- Interact with embedded content (e.g., videos, maps)
- Make a purchase or create an account (if applicable)
- Visit pages or interact with site features (cookies or tracking scripts may be used)

I may use third-party tools to help operate this website and deliver my services. These providers may process your personal data on my behalf, and in line with data protection regulations.

These include:

- **MailerLite** (email marketing)
- **Google Analytics** (site analytics)

These services have their own privacy policies and data handling practices. I encourage you to review them if you have concerns.

I do not sell or rent your personal information. You can unsubscribe from any emails at any time using the link at the bottom of my messages.

For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), the UK, or other regions with privacy laws, know that I process your data based on your consent. You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal data at any time.

If youâ€™re a California resident, you have the right to know what personal data I collect, request deletion, and opt out of any data sharing (even though I do not sell your data).

If you have any questions or wish to exercise your privacy rights, email me at bas@ontestautomation.com
